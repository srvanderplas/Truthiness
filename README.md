# Truthiness

Truthiness - the quality of seeming or being felt to be true, even if not necessarily true.

Research suggests that the [truthiness effect](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-012-0292-0) may be a factor in [jury decision making](https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/jurexp25&section=53). This repository contains code and data necessary to produce stimuli used to examine whether the truthiness effect holds for statistical charts and maps. 

Two types of facts are used: facts which are only spatial in nature (e.g. those for which a properly labeled map would be probative) and facts which also depend on additional data (e.g. demographics). For the 6 facts in each category, three are true and three are false. 

Each fact has several accompanying images:
- A non-probative unrelated picture
- A non-probative related picture
- A non-probative chart related to the subject of the claim (but not the topic)
- A non-probative chart unrelated to the topic or subject of the claim
- A non-probative chart related to the topic of the claim (but not the subject)
- A probative chart related to the subject and topic of the claim
- A non-probative map related to the subject of the claim (but not the topic)
- A non-probative map unrelated to the topic or subject of the claim
- A non-probative map related to the topic of the claim (but not the subject)
- A non-probative map related to the subject and topic of the claim
- A probative map related to the subject and topic of the claim

As the truthiness effect seems to be based on the familiarity of recalled information, we expect that maps and charts may trigger different levels of familiarity; we also expect this effect may be moderated by whether there is a non-spatial component to the question.
