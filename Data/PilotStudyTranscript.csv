## Participant 1 = userID 26
26, 1, "Well, OK, so, the picture says that more than three do; the picture says that one two three four five six, six countries get more than 50%, so. But it doesn't say only three countries, it says three south american countries get. It's a very broad, open ended statement in and of itself because it doesn't say only three. So I'm going to say that this one is true."
26, 2, "I love the picture. The picture is great. I feel like I might have read the last picture wrong. This one has absolutely nothing to do with the statement. But, nuclear power is still pretty new. I believe that Switzerland would probably be one of those countries that would make nuclear power just because it's clean energy and Switzerland is kind of odd like that. One of three countries. I don't think that there are three countries that get more than 30% of their power from nuclear power plants. so I'm going to go with False on that."
26, 3, "OK. Population. Qatar. I think that Qatar was one of the more progressive middle eastern countries, so I'm pretty sure that their neighboring countries are UAE and Saudi Arabia. So that's not true, Saudi Arabia... UAE definitely has a lot of working age women. I'm going to say that this one is false."
26, 4, "Perfect. Picture is India's ethnic makeup. So Russia borders the coast. They border the coast on the northern end and ... inaudible... which is also extremely large. But the entire continent of Australia is in the middle of the ocean and is one country. Russia is enormous, that's a lot of ocean. So I'm going to say this one is true."
26, 5, "This one is super, super false. That entire area is very underdeveloped. Just because of how underdeveloped central america is in most portions. The cities would obviously have electricity, but the rest of the population doesn't live in the city. I'm going to say... I'll say this one's true. "
26, 6, "Nah, there's no way. Egypt has two, three different land borders. I believe, unless they only border two countries and one wraps around the bottom. I believe that Egypt has three different land borders, and then, they do have two coastal borders, but I don't think those coastal borders are very large. Unless. Cause they only have one outlet into the ocean, regardless, on the Nile. So I think this one is false."
26, 7, "This one sounds like it could be fairly true. Over 95%. I don't even know how many people Belgium has in it. Probably one to two million, somewhere in there. And a lot of Europe has ... a lot of Europe is very urban rural developed. So I'm going to say that this one is false."
26, 8, "Um. I don't know where that is. According to this chart, it says Swaziland's border regions and measures the length in km. South Africa has over 400, Mozambique has over 100. So unless this graph is lying to me like a jerk, this one has to be false."
26, 9, "Ah, shoot. Black Sea. The black sea, I believe, is this area, so then... I mean, ... inaudible..., Certainly has one, two, three, I feel like I was right about the Egypt one. I'm pretty confident about that. Seven countries. Seven countries, ..., Europe, ... no, I think that one's false. Europe in this area doesn't have a lot of countries. Italy sticking it's foot into that area, and there's not a lot of southern areas. I'm going to say that one is false."
26, 10, "OK, know it's not first, that's Russia. Alaska is the size of... the size of like everything. It's showing a wallaby. I'm super confused. Australia is also quite large, Australia, I believe is bigger than Brazil. I could see it's quite large. I'm going with true. It's large as a lot of countries out there. Brazil... those YouTube videos where they put Alaska over like everything. Going to go with True."
26, 11, "Paraguay is in Central america. I don't think that's landlocked. If I remember correctly, it has a coast. So I'm gonna go with false on this one."
26, 12, "Really niche... Huh. I think that this one is false. South Africa is I believe the most developed of all the African nations, which is partially why you hear about it so much, because they actually have a presence. And the more developed you are, the higher your youth population is going to be because they have increased odds of surviving both childbirth and being young. So I'm going to say this one is false."
## Participant 2 = userID 27
27, 1, "Well, so Belgium is a relatively small country in land mass, but I don't know how large their rural population is. The population density needed for over 95% of the population to be in urban areas. It's in northwestern Europe, so probably fairly heavily populated, umm... I just don't think the population density is high enough for there to be that many people inside the urban areas."
27, 2, "OK, so Qatar. I can't remember a lot about that country. It's fairly heavily based in the energy industry. Surrounding countries... only really bordering Saudi Arabia. I'm assuming because there's a fairly wide gender gap in men and women working, I don't know enough to say for sure, umm, but in the absence of anything to say otherwise, I'm going to say false."
27, 3, "Paraguay is landlocked... um. What does this graph have to do with it? Disregarding the graph, Paraguay is in Central/South America, um, I think I remember something about it having a navy, but I can't say for sure. Just because of the ratio of countries that border water vs. those that don't, I'm going to say true for this question."
27, 4, "Disregarding the graph, which doesn't seem to be related to this question at all, and considering I know almost nothing about the population of Belize, um, barring any access to further knowledge, I'm going to say false on this one, just due to the proportion of the world population that does have access to electricity."
27, 5, "Russia has a very large land mass, on the eastern border you have Siberia, border the pacific ocean, a bit of coastal border on the western side. Assuming that the graph is correct, Canada would have a longer border by far, which does make sense because they have full borders with both the Pacific and Atlantic ocean. So I'm going to say false to this statement."
27, 6, "I'm disregarding the map because it doesn't seem to be anywhere near Swaziland. Considering that I know pretty much nothing about the geographic location of Swaziland. I'm going to default to false, considering that most countries would have more than one country on their border."
27, 7, "Well, I know that there are multiple. I know that so there's Turkey to the South, um, Russia also has black sea holdings, and the Baltics, that would be Romania and others, I think the number should be somewhere around 7, so barring complete knowledge, I'm going to say this statement is true."
27, 8, "Um, the graph does not seem to be applicable to this. I know that Brazil has a fairly large land mass. I know it's smaller than Russia, the US, maybe China, Canada... Canada has a very large land mass too. So yeah, that sounds about right. This is true."
27, 9, "OK. Well, this is another one that I do not know a lot about. Um. I know that in some South American countries, oil is a very large industry, but I don't know if they use that oil to generate electricity or if they just sell it. Um. I know there's a lot of water flowing rivers down there, so it's possible. Um. Suppose there are a large number of ...inaudible... well, no, South America, not central. Barring other information, I'm going to say this is false, just because that I haven't heard of such feats going on in South America, but that doesn't mean it is impossible."
27, 10, "So I know Egypt is a nation int he north east part of Africa. It has a northern border to the Mediterranean. It has an eastern border to the bit of water that runs to the Suez canal. That sounds about right, because it has land borders to the south and west, and sea borders to the north and east, so I'm going to say this statement is true."
27, 11, "OK, well this is another subject that I do not know much about. I haven't heard much about nuclear power in Switzerland. It's possible, I mean they have the technological and industrial ability to do it, it's a fairly small country, so it could get a fair amount of it's power from nuclear power. Given that nuclear power is a fairly well founded means of generating power, especially in Europe, I'm going to say this one is true, barring further information."
27, 12, "So I'm going to take this question to mean that they have the... um. that they're in the bottom 15 of population density. For like, proportion per land mass, and not any other thing they could be compared against. Um. I know that South Africa is fairly populous, and if we're going by land mass, I don't think they'd be that far down there for the proportion of population to land. Um, so I'm going to put this one as false. "
## Participant 3 = userID 28
28, 1, "So one is at 100 for hydroelectric, that's Paraguay. Ecuador is the same way, and Brazil is the same way, so that is true."
28, 2, "Um, I can't tell whether that's true or not. It shows a picture of one nuclear power plant. So I'll say that's false."
28, 3, "The graph has to do with religion, so it's false."
28, 4, "I would say that it would be surprising if that was true, so it's false."
28, 5, "Um, the graph is about Australia's exports. I would say that it's the United states... no, China, India, the united states, I'd say Brazil is the largest country."
28, 6, "That's a pretty small country, so that's pretty reasonable to say. So true."
28, 7, "Uh, it's a pretty wealthy African country... lowest proportion of the population under 15. Um, that would make sense then, because it'd have a lot more older people than other countries would."
28, 8, "Qatar is surrounded. It's in the middle east. I wouldn't say there's any reason for that to be true. Other countries around it would have the same discrepancy. So that's false."
28, 9, "Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, Ukraine, um, I would say that's false. There's less than seven. "
28, 10, "Paraguay... it's uh it shows the length of the borders and the coastline is zero, so it would be landlocked."
28, 11, "It's completely surrounded by a country, so yes, it's only bordered by one country."
28, 12, "Well, out of any country. It borders the pacific. Uh. Longest coastal border. Only other country I can think of would be like Canada. I'd say Russia's probably has the longest. "
## Participant 4 = userID 29
29, 1, "Um, I'm fairly certain that Belgium has quite a few rural areas, but I guess it could make sense... no, almost entirely positive that it's not 95%. It's probably closer to 75% lives in urban areas."
29, 2, "Given by the map, Qatar is next to Saudi Arabia. I've got a pretty solid feeling that Saudi Arabia has a larger discrepancy in the proportion between men and women. Is that what the question is asking? Is the difference between men and women working? Or the number of men to women working? OK, just wanted to double check. "
29, 3, "It's on the eastern side of Europe. Pretty sure it's less than seven countries that border the Black Sea. I'm not very good at geography. It was never my strong subject. false."
29, 4, "This picture doesn't quite go with the question, but, other than that. I'm fairly certain that it has more land borders than coastal borders. Yeah, approximately equal. It's kinda shaped like a rectangle, and the top side and the other side are ... two sides are water and two sides are land."
29, 5, "Umm. Well, no. There's one, two. Yay, I can count."
29, 6, "Brazil is the 5th largest country. One two three four five, look at that. Yay!"
29, 7, "It's Beijing. Hmm. It's labeled Beijing, China. There's the Paraguay river. Whoops. I can't remember where Paraguay is. I mean, I know it's in South America. No, it's on the east northern border of South America. "
29, 8, "Is this under the age of 15? OK, just wanted to double check. Proportion. Hmm. I want to say no, but I don't have a reason for it."
29, 9, "That cat's really cute. It's not helpful, but he's cute. Hmm. Switzerland's pretty little. I'm thinking yeah, totally. Accept it. "
29, 10, "Chile is a yes. Brazil is probably a yes. Hmm. True, I guess."
29, 11, "Yes, true. because there are umm. Well, I'm fairly certain that it's that large of a percentage that has... wait, yes. I mean. yes. that's right. "
29, 12, "I mean, it's a big-ass country. Yes. "
## Participant 5 = userID 30
30, 1, "Um. I don't even see... South Africa. Oh! Wait... Monaco. South Africa isn't even on this graph, so it doesn't border France. Right? Yeah. Proportion of the population under 15 of all African nations. Wait, this graph doesn't ... laughs... South Africa has the lowest portion of the population under 15 of all African nations. So this graph has nothing to do with it. Under 15 of all African nations. I thought South Africa had a big population, so I'm going to go with false."
30, 2, "None of these graphs have... wait, oh, wait, maybe it does. Yeah, this one does. Wait. No, it doesn't have anything to do with it. This graph is about salt salinity of the water, not which countries border it. So, the black sea is moderate in salinity, but I'm going to go... My knowledge of the Black Sea is very limited, so I'm going to say no... I'm going to say false, I don't think seven do."
30, 3, "Oh, that's hard. I don't think so. Cause, I feel like Brazil is one of the like most like developed... they're in the developing to developed countries. But then I feel like every other country is either like worse off than them, and they're not really good with renewable energy, especially not with their new president. So, I'm going to say, I'm going to say... ooh, but hydroelectric... I'm going to say false, cause I don't think that would be something in their infrastructure. "
30, 4, "Um, this map doesn't help much. What do we know about Paraguay? I don't think it is. Cause, I believe it's in Central America, and most of those have some form of water on either side. I'm going to go false."
30, 5, "This graph, this graph is of Australia. So it doesn't help. But, Russia's the first, then Australia, or China, Canada's pretty big, so that's four. So it's either that or another one. What country would be bigger? I'm going to go true. I feel like Brazil is pretty big. If it's not the 5th it's in the top ten. I'm going to go true."
30, 6, "I don't know what Swaziland is. So that doesn't... Um. Swaziland. Well, I feel bad. Wow. Cause I don't know anything about it, I'm going to say true. No, should I say false? This one's like 50/50, it's true or false and I'm not sure. So I'm going to go... I'm going to say false. No, I'm going to go true. I'm going to go true."
30, 7, "Belgium. That seems like a really high percentage. I feel like you have to have rural areas in your country. Like over 5%. I'm going to go false. I feel like that's just insane, like for an entire country to be entirely urban? False."
30, 8, "Egypt's border regions. Oh, wait. This one. This graph actually correlates with what I believe. So it's almost 2500, 1125, 1000, Yeah. I'm going to say this is true. Cause the graph. Yeah. If this is all the coastal borders, which I don't really know Egypt's borders. So I'm going to assume this is true, because I think the graph is representing what it wants me to look at."
30, 9, "Population demographics. Working... lower rate... I don't know if these graphs have anything to do with working. Working age men and women... It does have to do with gender, and ages. So other than it not saying... oh, working age. Working age is 18 to ... 18 to like. I don't know. I'm going to just look at these graphs and try to figure it out. Qatar has the largest... I don't know where Qatar is... Oh yeah, 25 - 54, that's probably working age. This is true. That was probably harder than it should have been."
30, 10, "Hmm. I'm going to go with true. I know that electricity... like, Belize is a developing country, so electricity is probably something that they lack, with regards to the entire population. Less than 85%, that's like 15 or less that actually do. And Belize is a small country. I'm still going to say true, because I feel like... I'm leaning towards true, just cause I know, er I don't know I assume they have a lot of work to do with electricity for people."
30, 11, "OK, this graph doesn't have anything to do with it, because it's about population and age, not energy. 30% isn't that much. Yeah, go true. They probably. Mmh it is... I'm still going true, just because Switzerland sustainable energy."
30, 12, "Coastal border. Oh, coastline. This key does not help me, though. It doesn't tell me if 1 is a lot of coast length or a little. So it's a 4, which means it isn't even the longest - it would be a 1 or a 5. I'm going to assume 1 is the longest... Oh, maybe they're ranked. They're probably ranked. OK, it's not. So, that's like no."
## Participant 6 = userID 31
31, 1, "Yes, if that is Paraguay."
31, 2, "Count 1, 2, 3, ish, 4, 5, 6. So false"
31, 3, "Nice picture of a dam. Um. Three, that seems reasonable."
31, 4, "I do not know, I'm going to have to guess that it's true."
31, 5, "Um. I think that's true... a lot of people live in urban areas."
31, 6, "This graph has nothing to do with the question. Ok, um, more than 30%... I think that's true. "
31, 7, "I think it borders two. That's false."
31, 8, "Yeah, this graph does not have anything to do with electricity. That's false. Wait, less than... that's probably true. "
31, 9, "That seems pretty true. Russia is pretty big."
31, 10, "Hmm. Yeah, I think that's true."
31, 11, "The lowest... no, that's false"
31, 12, "This is not Egypt. Um. Approximately equal land and coastal borders. I don't think so. "
## Participant 7 = userID 32
32, 1, "Umm, I would say that's probably true. I don't have reasoning to suggest otherwise. I don't really know much about South American countries, but."
32, 2, "I think that's true. From what I remember from my geography days"
32, 3, "I think that's false. 85% is a pretty high number to not have access to electricity."
32, 4, "I think that might be true. Hmm. I'm not sure why my reasoning. I'm just. I don't really have any reasoning otherwise, but it sounds like it might be correct."
32, 5, "That's false, cause there's two countries around it in the picture at least."
32, 6, "I think that's true, from what I can remember from a South America map"
32, 7, "I think that's false. Umm. Because I know ... I'm pretty sure South Africa has a pretty large population, so I think that would be false."
32, 8, "Umm. From the graph it looks like it's false. It looks like it's under 20%. So I think that's false."
32, 9, "Umm. I think that might be true. It kind of looks like it could be equal on the map. "
32, 10, "Umm. I would say that's true. Russia is a pretty big country, so possibly. I think so. "
32, 11, "Umm. True, maybe. I think it might be true because I think most people  in Europe live in more urban areas, so I think that might be correct."
32, 12, "I think that's false. I think there's ... I think some of the other countries would be a little bit bigger."
## Participant 8 = userID 33
33, 1, "Brazil is a country. Brazil is very large. It is in South America. I am thinking that there's Russia, Canada, United States, Australia, Antarctica. So I will go with true. That seems true."
33, 2, "I'm not seeing a year, so I'm guessing that is currently. I don't know much about what's going on with Belize at the moment. The demographics show... The barchart shows that the population type (rural or urban) with the percent electrical access out of 100. This doesn't tell me what percent of Belize's population has electricity, so I'm not going to use this graph. It does have a difference between countries and .... what? Some of the countries don't show 100% with electrical access, so either there's a space outside of rural and urban that isn't accounted for, or essentially 100% has access to electricity in Belize. I'm guessing it's not less than 85% just because that's irration... not irrational, but not likely, unless there was something major happened recently. I'm going to go with false."
33, 3, "Ok. Percent of population atthe bottom, age ranges. Once again, this doesn't tell me anything about where Belgium's population lives. It doesn't even list Belgium on the side as one of the countries. So. Demographics in Southern Europe. Yeah, this is useless. Uh, I'm going to go with... urban areas. No, Belgium is... I don't know much about Belgium. I was thiking of Lithuania... no, Luxembourg. A tiny country where it's all urban. I'm going to say that not over 95% of Belgium's population lives in urban areas. It does have some large cities, but I'm going to say most of it is still people spread throughout, even though it is a smaller country. I'm going to go with false."
33, 4, "So I know that globes are ... and this is a globe map I'm being shown... are stretched out towards the middle equator rather than being even across. So it looks strange. Just thinking of any country. Uh. It's not asking percent wise, so this would be in distance. Uh. That could be true. Canada has a lot of coastal border, and so does Australia. Russia is very large. And I can't think of hmm. I can't think of another country that has essentially a large portion of its mass in a peninsula. So this is probably true."
33, 5, "With a picture of the United States, Mexico and Canada. North America. (reading fact again) So. I have no idea which countries get power from nuclear power plants. Recently, I've seen that power plants are getting shut down slowly, being put out of use. I don't recall if any were in switzerland, but I don't believe that's the case. Gets more than 30% of their power from nuclear power plants. I do not know. But. I'm going to go with no, just because ... 30% seems like quite a bit to be getting from nuclear power plants alone, but they do provide quite a bit of power. I don't know how many they have, and I haven't heard of there being nuclear power plants in switzerland, so I'm going to go with false."
33, 6, "China's population. Not helpful. Paraguay. South America. I think it's to the east of northern peru. So that would make it landlocked. I'm going to go with true."
33, 7, "I have never heard of this country, unless I'm forgetting it. It looks... If it's in Africa that could be the case. it looks like an African country name. Only borders one country. That's a weird sentance. It looks like Eswatini is part of Swaziland, which would probably make it not a country. I'm going to go with false because of that."
33, 8, "The black sea is in southern europe. Seven countries. I'm going to say Spain, I don't know which countries are bordering the black sea. There are at least 4 or 5 around that area that I know, on the west to east end on the north side. I don't know if the black sea extends into african countries, to border african countries. I'm betting that's at least two countries. Going with true."
33, 9, "Qatar. Qatar is in eastern europe, right? Let me think... yes. East. yes. The largest discrepancy between the proportion of working age men and women compared to neighboring countries. Largest discrepancy between the proportion of working age men and women. So the difference between men and women working age, not working. It doesn't say anything about people working. Compared to neighboring countries. With a picture of a city. Which is to lead me to believe it's a large city. I would be looking at populations in the city. The United States having a large population is close to 50%, and most countries are close. I want to say Some African countries have higher rates of birth for one gender over the other. I can't remember which way that goes. 17 seconds. I'm going to go with ... false because I don't know enough. I'm just going to say false."
33, 10, "So once again population for south american countries, which is closer to correct but tells me nothing about electricity generated from hydroelectric generators. I seriously doubt that it's higher than 50% for just hydroelectric generation, especially for 3 different countries. They'd have to... I'm assuming they'd have strong river throughout all of it, and it can't be Brazil, because the size of Brazil is just too large. Even though there are many, many rivers through Brazil, I don't think they're utilizing hydroelectricity for 50% of the power needed. I'm going to go with false, because that seems like too much energy from hydroelectric."
33, 11, "Has approximately equal land and coastal borders to what? Equal land and coastal borders. Um. Equal land to coastal borders? Yeah, equal land and coastal borders. So... has approximately equal land and coastal borders.It is bordering... So this is Egypt. Probably. It looks like part of Northern Africa. This picture is showing that it is bordering 3 countries by land and 2 bodies of water on several sides. I'm going to go with ... approximately equal. I mean... I don't know what approximately equal is supposed to mean. I'm going to go with false, because even the sides of this country shown do not look equal in water to land borders. "
33, 12, "Southern africa working age population. Southern AFrica working age populations. South Africa has the lowest proportion of the population under 15 of all african nations. So I can't know this from this graph because it shows working age population and it's asking for under 15. So I know there's a high birth rate, but... the age range is for countries in Africa. There's a higher population of younger individuals in Africa than there are of older demographics in other... The proportion from younger to older individuals in Africa is much higher than in other countries. So I can't tell from this graph showing the population between 25 and 54. Population percent. Southern Africa is on the South end of Africa. I'm going to go with false, because I don't think there's as much poverty in some other countries in Africa. Yes. I believe there's less poverty in South Africa, which would lead to people... lead to more births too... I'm going to go with false, after all that. "
## Participant 9 = userID 34
34, 1, "This statement is... hmm... Switzerland is one of three countries who get more than 30% from nuclear power plants. Once again, I'm going to go with true. Like, I'm not 100% sure on this at all, but I feel that nuclear power is really where the world is heading, and I feel like Switzerland and many other European countries like Germany... western European countries like Germany and Italy are leading that movement."
34, 2, "I feel like this question is like, it should be like an obvious true, but at the same time I feel like it may be tricking me, there's like that other country with the really long border that I'm not thinking of off the top of my head. Plus, you know pretty much every question I've answered so far, which isn't a lot, only two, has been true, so I'm inclined to pick false, but based on what I know about countries, like Russia is a massive country. I'm just going to go false. When I picture Russia's map, it is a big country, but. Yeah, actually, Russia doesn't have that big of a coastal border. Most of Eastern Asia is occupied by China, at least like the coastal areas, so I'm just going to say false for that."
34, 3, "Black sea is somewhere near the Mediterranean/the Middle East. Yeah, that seems about right. I definitely don't know all the countries in the middle east, but seven countries could definitely border the black sea, so I'll say true for that."
34, 4, "Ok, not entirely sure why they have this graph here. Population of European nations. Not sure why this graph is here. I'm just going to ignore that. Hmm. I mean, there's like I'd say 14-15 countries in South America, and I feel like at least 3 of them could possibly get at least 50% of their electricity from hydroelectric generation. At the same time, most of the countries in South America are developing. Actually, I feel that would be more of a reason why they would. Ok, I'm picking a lot of true... Hmm. I'm just goin gto pick true. In hindsight, that may have been wrong"
34, 5, "Now I just feel obligated to say false. "
34, 6, "Again, ... Beijing China, except clearly none of the names of the locations in this map are Chinese whatsoever. Anyways, Paraguay is landlocked. I think that's true."
34, 7, "Finally, a picture that actually relates to the question. Hmm. One, two, three. I think Brazil might be a little bit higher up than the 5th largest country, at least based on this map. Russia, Canada, China, ... then the United States... 1, 2, 3, 4, and actually that looks about right. True statement."
34, 8, "I feel like I'm supposed to associate something with these pictures. Like, not necessarily leading towards the right answer, but possibly tricking me to associate Belize with poverty because they're showing all of these African countries. Less than 85% of the population of Belize... Ok, that does not sound true at all. Way too high of a percentage. I'll say false"

34, 11, "South Africa has the lowest proportion of the population under 15... lowest proportion of the population under 15. So what I think this question is saying is that compared to most countries, it has a lower number of population under 15. So I'm going to say false. I feel like that may be a little bit of lazy thinking on my part, because I'm not processing the question as much as I should be, but whatever. submit."

I feel it wouldn't be the largest... not even paying attention to the graphic by the way, because it has nothing to do with the question."
