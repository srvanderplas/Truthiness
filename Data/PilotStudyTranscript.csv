26, 1, "Well, OK, so, the picture says that more than three do; the picture says that one two three four five six, six countries get more than 50%, so. But it doesn't say only three countries, it says three south american countries get. It's a very broad, open ended statement in and of itself because it doesn't say only three. So I'm going to say that this one is true."
26, 2, "I love the picture. The picture is great. I feel like I might have read the last picture wrong. This one has absolutely nothing to do with the statement. But, nuclear power is still pretty new. I believe that Switzerland would probably be one of those countries that would make nuclear power just because it's clean energy and Switzerland is kind of odd like that. One of three countries. I don't think that there are three countries that get more than 30% of their power from nuclear power plants. so I'm going to go with False on that."
26, 3, "OK. Population. Qatar. I think that Qatar was one of the more progressive middle eastern countries, so I'm pretty sure that their neighboring countries are UAE and Saudi Arabia. So that's not true, Saudi Arabia... UAE definitely has a lot of working age women. I'm going to say that this one is false."
26, 4, "Perfect. Picture is India's ethnic makeup. So Russia borders the coast. They border the coast on the northern end and ... inaudible... which is also extremely large. But the entire continent of Australia is in the middle of the ocean and is one country. Russia is enormous, that's a lot of ocean. So I'm going to say this one is true."
26, 5, "This one is super, super false. That entire area is very underdeveloped. Just because of how underdeveloped central america is in most portions. The cities would obviously have electricity, but the rest of the population doesn't live in the city. I'm going to say... I'll say this one's true. "
26, 6, "Nah, there's no way. Egypt has two, three different land borders. I believe, unless they only border two countries and one wraps around the bottom. I believe that Egypt has three different land borders, and then, they do have two coastal borders, but I don't think those coastal borders are very large. Unless. Cause they only have one outlet into the ocean, regardless, on the Nile. So I think this one is false."
26, 7, "This one sounds like it could be fairly true. Over 95%. I don't even know how many people Belgium has in it. Probably one to two million, somewhere in there. And a lot of Europe has ... a lot of Europe is very urban rural developed. So I'm going to say that this one is false."
26, 8, "Um. I don't know where that is. According to this chart, it says Swaziland's border regions and measures the length in km. South Africa has over 400, Mozambique has over 100. So unless this graph is lying to me like a jerk, this one has to be false."
26, 9, "Ah, shoot. Black Sea. The black sea, I believe, is this area, so then... I mean, ... inaudible..., Certainly has one, two, three, I feel like I was right about the Egypt one. I'm pretty confident about that. Seven countries. Seven countries, ..., Europe, ... no, I think that one's false. Europe in this area doesn't have a lot of countries. Italy sticking it's foot into that area, and there's not a lot of southern areas. I'm going to say that one is false."
26, 10, "OK, know it's not first, that's Russia. Alaska is the size of... the size of like everything. It's showing a wallaby. I'm super confused. Australia is also quite large, Australia, I believe is bigger than Brazil. I could see it's quite large. I'm going with true. It's large as a lot of countries out there. Brazil... those YouTube videos where they put Alaska over like everything. Going to go with True."
26, 11, "Paraguay is in Central america. I don't think that's landlocked. If I remember correctly, it has a coast. So I'm gonna go with false on this one."
26, 12, "Really niche... Huh. I think that this one is false. South Africa is I believe the most developed of all the African nations, which is partially why you hear about it so much, because they actually have a presence. And the more developed you are, the higher your youth population is going to be because they have increased odds of surviving both childbirth and being young. So I'm going to say this one is false."
