## Participant 1 = userID 26
26, 1, "Well, OK, so, the picture says that more than three do; the picture says that one two three four five six, six countries get more than 50%, so. But it doesn't say only three countries, it says three south american countries get. It's a very broad, open ended statement in and of itself because it doesn't say only three. So I'm going to say that this one is true."
26, 2, "I love the picture. The picture is great. I feel like I might have read the last picture wrong. This one has absolutely nothing to do with the statement. But, nuclear power is still pretty new. I believe that Switzerland would probably be one of those countries that would make nuclear power just because it's clean energy and Switzerland is kind of odd like that. One of three countries. I don't think that there are three countries that get more than 30% of their power from nuclear power plants. so I'm going to go with False on that."
26, 3, "OK. Population. Qatar. I think that Qatar was one of the more progressive middle eastern countries, so I'm pretty sure that their neighboring countries are UAE and Saudi Arabia. So that's not true, Saudi Arabia... UAE definitely has a lot of working age women. I'm going to say that this one is false."
26, 4, "Perfect. Picture is India's ethnic makeup. So Russia borders the coast. They border the coast on the northern end and ... inaudible... which is also extremely large. But the entire continent of Australia is in the middle of the ocean and is one country. Russia is enormous, that's a lot of ocean. So I'm going to say this one is true."
26, 5, "This one is super, super false. That entire area is very underdeveloped. Just because of how underdeveloped central america is in most portions. The cities would obviously have electricity, but the rest of the population doesn't live in the city. I'm going to say... I'll say this one's true. "
26, 6, "Nah, there's no way. Egypt has two, three different land borders. I believe, unless they only border two countries and one wraps around the bottom. I believe that Egypt has three different land borders, and then, they do have two coastal borders, but I don't think those coastal borders are very large. Unless. Cause they only have one outlet into the ocean, regardless, on the Nile. So I think this one is false."
26, 7, "This one sounds like it could be fairly true. Over 95%. I don't even know how many people Belgium has in it. Probably one to two million, somewhere in there. And a lot of Europe has ... a lot of Europe is very urban rural developed. So I'm going to say that this one is false."
26, 8, "Um. I don't know where that is. According to this chart, it says Swaziland's border regions and measures the length in km. South Africa has over 400, Mozambique has over 100. So unless this graph is lying to me like a jerk, this one has to be false."
26, 9, "Ah, shoot. Black Sea. The black sea, I believe, is this area, so then... I mean, ... inaudible..., Certainly has one, two, three, I feel like I was right about the Egypt one. I'm pretty confident about that. Seven countries. Seven countries, ..., Europe, ... no, I think that one's false. Europe in this area doesn't have a lot of countries. Italy sticking it's foot into that area, and there's not a lot of southern areas. I'm going to say that one is false."
26, 10, "OK, know it's not first, that's Russia. Alaska is the size of... the size of like everything. It's showing a wallaby. I'm super confused. Australia is also quite large, Australia, I believe is bigger than Brazil. I could see it's quite large. I'm going with true. It's large as a lot of countries out there. Brazil... those YouTube videos where they put Alaska over like everything. Going to go with True."
26, 11, "Paraguay is in Central america. I don't think that's landlocked. If I remember correctly, it has a coast. So I'm gonna go with false on this one."
26, 12, "Really niche... Huh. I think that this one is false. South Africa is I believe the most developed of all the African nations, which is partially why you hear about it so much, because they actually have a presence. And the more developed you are, the higher your youth population is going to be because they have increased odds of surviving both childbirth and being young. So I'm going to say this one is false."
## Participant 2 = userID 27
27, 1, "Well, so Belgium is a relatively small country in land mass, but I don't know how large their rural population is. The population density needed for over 95% of the population to be in urban areas. It's in northwestern Europe, so probably fairly heavily populated, umm... I just don't think the population density is high enough for there to be that many people inside the urban areas."
27, 2, "OK, so Qatar. I can't remember a lot about that country. It's fairly heavily based in the energy industry. Surrounding countries... only really bordering Saudi Arabia. I'm assuming because there's a fairly wide gender gap in men and women working, I don't know enough to say for sure, umm, but in the absence of anything to say otherwise, I'm going to say false."
27, 3, "Paraguay is landlocked... um. What does this graph have to do with it? Disregarding the graph, Paraguay is in Central/South America, um, I think I remember something about it having a navy, but I can't say for sure. Just because of the ratio of countries that border water vs. those that don't, I'm going to say true for this question."
27, 4, "Disregarding the graph, which doesn't seem to be related to this question at all, and considering I know almost nothing about the population of Belize, um, barring any access to further knowledge, I'm going to say false on this one, just due to the proportion of the world population that does have access to electricity."
27, 5, "Russia has a very large land mass, on the eastern border you have Siberia, border the pacific ocean, a bit of coastal border on the western side. Assuming that the graph is correct, Canada would have a longer border by far, which does make sense because they have full borders with both the Pacific and Atlantic ocean. So I'm going to say false to this statement."
27, 6, "I'm disregarding the map because it doesn't seem to be anywhere near Swaziland. Considering that I know pretty much nothing about the geographic location of Swaziland. I'm going to default to false, considering that most countries would have more than one country on their border."
27, 7, "Well, I know that there are multiple. I know that so there's Turkey to the South, um, Russia also has black sea holdings, and the Baltics, that would be Romania and others, I think the number should be somewhere around 7, so barring complete knowledge, I'm going to say this statement is true."
27, 8, "Um, the graph does not seem to be applicable to this. I know that Brazil has a fairly large land mass. I know it's smaller than Russia, the US, maybe China, Canada... Canada has a very large land mass too. So yeah, that sounds about right. This is true."
27, 9, "OK. Well, this is another one that I do not know a lot about. Um. I know that in some South American countries, oil is a very large industry, but I don't know if they use that oil to generate electricity or if they just sell it. Um. I know there's a lot of water flowing rivers down there, so it's possible. Um. Suppose there are a large number of ...inaudible... well, no, South America, not central. Barring other information, I'm going to say this is false, just because that I haven't heard of such feats going on in South America, but that doesn't mean it is impossible."
27, 10, "So I know Egypt is a nation int he north east part of Africa. It has a northern border to the Mediterranean. It has an eastern border to the bit of water that runs to the Suez canal. That sounds about right, because it has land borders to the south and west, and sea borders to the north and east, so I'm going to say this statement is true."
27, 11, "OK, well this is another subject that I do not know much about. I haven't heard much about nuclear power in Switzerland. It's possible, I mean they have the technological and industrial ability to do it, it's a fairly small country, so it could get a fair amount of it's power from nuclear power. Given that nuclear power is a fairly well founded means of generating power, especially in Europe, I'm going to say this one is true, barring further information."
27, 12, "So I'm going to take this question to mean that they have the... um. that they're in the bottom 15 of population density. For like, proportion per land mass, and not any other thing they could be compared against. Um. I know that South Africa is fairly populous, and if we're going by land mass, I don't think they'd be that far down there for the proportion of population to land. Um, so I'm going to put this one as false. "
## Participant 3 = userID 28
28, 1, "So one is at 100 for hydroelectric, that's Paraguay. Ecuador is the same way, and Brazil is the same way, so that is true."
28, 2, "Um, I can't tell whether that's true or not. It shows a picture of one nuclear power plant. So I'll say that's false."
28, 3, "The graph has to do with religion, so it's false."
28, 4, "I would say that it would be surprising if that was true, so it's false."
28, 5, "Um, the graph is about Australia's exports. I would say that it's the United states... no, China, India, the united states, I'd say Brazil is the largest country."
28, 6, "That's a pretty small country, so that's pretty reasonable to say. So true."
28, 7, "Uh, it's a pretty wealthy African country... lowest proportion of the population under 15. Um, that would make sense then, because it'd have a lot more older people than other countries would."
28, 8, "Qatar is surrounded. It's in the middle east. I wouldn't say there's any reason for that to be true. Other countries around it would have the same discrepancy. So that's false."
28, 9, "Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, Ukraine, um, I would say that's false. There's less than seven. "
28, 10, "Paraguay... it's uh it shows the length of the borders and the coastline is zero, so it would be landlocked."
28, 11, "It's completely surrounded by a country, so yes, it's only bordered by one country."
28, 12, "Well, out of any country. It borders the pacific. Uh. Longest coastal border. Only other country I can think of would be like Canada. I'd say Russia's probably has the longest. "
## Participant 4 = userID 29
29, 1, "Um, I'm fairly certain that Belgium has quite a few rural areas, but I guess it could make sense... no, almost entirely positive that it's not 95%. It's probably closer to 75% lives in urban areas."
29, 2, "Given by the map, Qatar is next to Saudi Arabia. I've got a pretty solid feeling that Saudi Arabia has a larger discrepancy in the proportion between men and women. Is that what the question is asking? Is the difference between men and women working? Or the number of men to women working? OK, just wanted to double check. "
29, 3, "It's on the eastern side of Europe. Pretty sure it's less than seven countries that border the Black Sea. I'm not very good at geography. It was never my strong subject. false."
29, 4, "This picture doesn't quite go with the question, but, other than that. I'm fairly certain that it has more land borders than coastal borders. Yeah, approximately equal. It's kinda shaped like a rectangle, and the top side and the other side are ... two sides are water and two sides are land."
29, 5, "Umm. Well, no. There's one, two. Yay, I can count."
29, 6, "Brazil is the 5th largest country. One two three four five, look at that. Yay!"
29, 7, "It's Beijing. Hmm. It's labeled Beijing, China. There's the Paraguay river. Whoops. I can't remember where Paraguay is. I mean, I know it's in South America. No, it's on the east northern border of South America. "
29, 8, "Is this under the age of 15? OK, just wanted to double check. Proportion. Hmm. I want to say no, but I don't have a reason for it."
29, 9, "That cat's really cute. It's not helpful, but he's cute. Hmm. Switzerland's pretty little. I'm thinking yeah, totally. Accept it. "
29, 10, "Chile is a yes. Brazil is probably a yes. Hmm. True, I guess."
29, 11, "Yes, true. because there are umm. Well, I'm fairly certain that it's that large of a percentage that has... wait, yes. I mean. yes. that's right. "
29, 12, "I mean, it's a big-ass country. Yes. "
## Participant 5 = userID 30
30, 1, "Um. I don't even see... South Africa. Oh! Wait... Monaco. South Africa isn't even on this graph, so it doesn't border France. Right? Yeah. Proportion of the population under 15 of all African nations. Wait, this graph doesn't ... laughs... South Africa has the lowest portion of the population under 15 of all African nations. So this graph has nothing to do with it. Under 15 of all African nations. I thought South Africa had a big population, so I'm going to go with false."
30, 2, "None of these graphs have... wait, oh, wait, maybe it does. Yeah, this one does. Wait. No, it doesn't have anything to do with it. This graph is about salt salinity of the water, not which countries border it. So, the black sea is moderate in salinity, but I'm going to go... My knowledge of the Black Sea is very limited, so I'm going to say no... I'm going to say false, I don't think seven do."
30, 3, "Oh, that's hard. I don't think so. Cause, I feel like Brazil is one of the like most like developed... they're in the developing to developed countries. But then I feel like every other country is either like worse off than them, and they're not really good with renewable energy, especially not with their new president. So, I'm going to say, I'm going to say... ooh, but hydroelectric... I'm going to say false, cause I don't think that would be something in their infrastructure. "
30, 4, "Um, this map doesn't help much. What do we know about Paraguay? I don't think it is. Cause, I believe it's in Central America, and most of those have some form of water on either side. I'm going to go false."
30, 5, "This graph, this graph is of Australia. So it doesn't help. But, Russia's the first, then Australia, or China, Canada's pretty big, so that's four. So it's either that or another one. What country would be bigger? I'm going to go true. I feel like Brazil is pretty big. If it's not the 5th it's in the top ten. I'm going to go true."
30, 6, "I don't know what Swaziland is. So that doesn't... Um. Swaziland. Well, I feel bad. Wow. Cause I don't know anything about it, I'm going to say true. No, should I say false? This one's like 50/50, it's true or false and I'm not sure. So I'm going to go... I'm going to say false. No, I'm going to go true. I'm going to go true."
30, 7, "Belgium. That seems like a really high percentage. I feel like you have to have rural areas in your country. Like over 5%. I'm going to go false. I feel like that's just insane, like for an entire country to be entirely urban? False."
30, 8, "Egypt's border regions. Oh, wait. This one. This graph actually correlates with what I believe. So it's almost 2500, 1125, 1000, Yeah. I'm going to say this is true. Cause the graph. Yeah. If this is all the coastal borders, which I don't really know Egypt's borders. So I'm going to assume this is true, because I think the graph is representing what it wants me to look at."
30, 9, "Population demographics. Working... lower rate... I don't know if these graphs have anything to do with working. Working age men and women... It does have to do with gender, and ages. So other than it not saying... oh, working age. Working age is 18 to ... 18 to like. I don't know. I'm going to just look at these graphs and try to figure it out. Qatar has the largest... I don't know where Qatar is... Oh yeah, 25 - 54, that's probably working age. This is true. That was probably harder than it should have been."
30, 10, "Hmm. I'm going to go with true. I know that electricity... like, Belize is a developing country, so electricity is probably something that they lack, with regards to the entire population. Less than 85%, that's like 15 or less that actually do. And Belize is a small country. I'm still going to say true, because I feel like... I'm leaning towards true, just cause I know, er I don't know I assume they have a lot of work to do with electricity for people."
30, 11, "OK, this graph doesn't have anything to do with it, because it's about population and age, not energy. 30% isn't that much. Yeah, go true. They probably. Mmh it is... I'm still going true, just because Switzerland sustainable energy."
30, 12, "Coastal border. Oh, coastline. This key does not help me, though. It doesn't tell me if 1 is a lot of coast length or a little. So it's a 4, which means it isn't even the longest - it would be a 1 or a 5. I'm going to assume 1 is the longest... Oh, maybe they're ranked. They're probably ranked. OK, it's not. So, that's like no."
## Participant 6 = userID 31
31, 1, "Yes, if that is Paraguay."
31, 2, "Count 1, 2, 3, ish, 4, 5, 6. So false"
31, 3, "Nice picture of a dam. Um. Three, that seems reasonable."
31, 4, "I do not know, I'm going to have to guess that it's true."
31, 5, "Um. I think that's true... a lot of people live in urban areas."
31, 6, "This graph has nothing to do with the question. OK, um, more than 30%... I think that's true. "
31, 7, "I think it borders two. That's false."
31, 8, "Yeah, this graph does not have anything to do with electricity. That's false. Wait, less than... that's probably true. "
31, 9, "That seems pretty true. Russia is pretty big."
31, 10, "Hmm. Yeah, I think that's true."
31, 11, "The lowest... no, that's false"
31, 12, "This is not Egypt. Um. Approximately equal land and coastal borders. I don't think so. "
## Participant 7 = userID 32
32, 1, "Umm, I would say that's probably true. I don't have reasoning to suggest otherwise. I don't really know much about South American countries, but."
32, 2, "I think that's true. From what I remember from my geography days"
32, 3, "I think that's false. 85% is a pretty high number to not have access to electricity."
32, 4, "I think that might be true. Hmm. I'm not sure why my reasoning. I'm just. I don't really have any reasoning otherwise, but it sounds like it might be correct."
32, 5, "That's false, cause there's two countries around it in the picture at least."
32, 6, "I think that's true, from what I can remember from a South America map"
32, 7, "I think that's false. Umm. Because I know ... I'm pretty sure South Africa has a pretty large population, so I think that would be false."
32, 8, "Umm. From the graph it looks like it's false. It looks like it's under 20%. So I think that's false."
32, 9, "Umm. I think that might be true. It kind of looks like it could be equal on the map. "
32, 10, "Umm. I would say that's true. Russia is a pretty big country, so possibly. I think so. "
32, 11, "Umm. True, maybe. I think it might be true because I think most people  in Europe live in more urban areas, so I think that might be correct."
32, 12, "I think that's false. I think there's ... I think some of the other countries would be a little bit bigger."
## Participant 8 = userID 33
33, 1, "Brazil is a country. Brazil is very large. It is in South America. I am thinking that there's Russia, Canada, United States, Australia, Antarctica. So I will go with true. That seems true."
33, 2, "I'm not seeing a year, so I'm guessing that is currently. I don't know much about what's going on with Belize at the moment. The demographics show... The bar chart shows that the population type (rural or urban) with the percent electrical access out of 100. This doesn't tell me what percent of Belize's population has electricity, so I'm not going to use this graph. It does have a difference between countries and .... what? Some of the countries don't show 100% with electrical access, so either there's a space outside of rural and urban that isn't accounted for, or essentially 100% has access to electricity in Belize. I'm guessing it's not less than 85% just because that's irration... not irrational, but not likely, unless there was something major happened recently. I'm going to go with false."
33, 3, "OK. Percent of population at the bottom, age ranges. Once again, this doesn't tell me anything about where Belgium's population lives. It doesn't even list Belgium on the side as one of the countries. So. Demographics in Southern Europe. Yeah, this is useless. Uh, I'm going to go with... urban areas. No, Belgium is... I don't know much about Belgium. I was thinking of Lithuania... no, Luxembourg. A tiny country where it's all urban. I'm going to say that not over 95% of Belgium's population lives in urban areas. It does have some large cities, but I'm going to say most of it is still people spread throughout, even though it is a smaller country. I'm going to go with false."
33, 4, "So I know that globes are ... and this is a globe map I'm being shown... are stretched out towards the middle equator rather than being even across. So it looks strange. Just thinking of any country. Uh. It's not asking percent wise, so this would be in distance. Uh. That could be true. Canada has a lot of coastal border, and so does Australia. Russia is very large. And I can't think of hmm. I can't think of another country that has essentially a large portion of its mass in a peninsula. So this is probably true."
33, 5, "With a picture of the United States, Mexico and Canada. North America. (reading fact again) So. I have no idea which countries get power from nuclear power plants. Recently, I've seen that power plants are getting shut down slowly, being put out of use. I don't recall if any were in Switzerland, but I don't believe that's the case. Gets more than 30% of their power from nuclear power plants. I do not know. But. I'm going to go with no, just because ... 30% seems like quite a bit to be getting from nuclear power plants alone, but they do provide quite a bit of power. I don't know how many they have, and I haven't heard of there being nuclear power plants in Switzerland, so I'm going to go with false."
33, 6, "China's population. Not helpful. Paraguay. South America. I think it's to the east of northern Peru. So that would make it landlocked. I'm going to go with true."
33, 7, "I have never heard of this country, unless I'm forgetting it. It looks... If it's in Africa that could be the case. it looks like an African country name. Only borders one country. That's a weird sentence. It looks like Eswatini is part of Swaziland, which would probably make it not a country. I'm going to go with false because of that."
33, 8, "The black sea is in southern Europe. Seven countries. I'm going to say Spain, I don't know which countries are bordering the black sea. There are at least 4 or 5 around that area that I know, on the west to east end on the north side. I don't know if the black sea extends into African countries, to border African countries. I'm betting that's at least two countries. Going with true."
33, 9, "Qatar. Qatar is in eastern Europe, right? Let me think... yes. East. yes. The largest discrepancy between the proportion of working age men and women compared to neighboring countries. Largest discrepancy between the proportion of working age men and women. So the difference between men and women working age, not working. It doesn't say anything about people working. Compared to neighboring countries. With a picture of a city. Which is to lead me to believe it's a large city. I would be looking at populations in the city. The United States having a large population is close to 50%, and most countries are close. I want to say Some African countries have higher rates of birth for one gender over the other. I can't remember which way that goes. 17 seconds. I'm going to go with ... false because I don't know enough. I'm just going to say false."
33, 10, "So once again population for south american countries, which is closer to correct but tells me nothing about electricity generated from hydroelectric generators. I seriously doubt that it's higher than 50% for just hydroelectric generation, especially for 3 different countries. They'd have to... I'm assuming they'd have strong river throughout all of it, and it can't be Brazil, because the size of Brazil is just too large. Even though there are many, many rivers through Brazil, I don't think they're utilizing hydroelectricity for 50% of the power needed. I'm going to go with false, because that seems like too much energy from hydroelectric."
33, 11, "Has approximately equal land and coastal borders to what? Equal land and coastal borders. Um. Equal land to coastal borders? Yeah, equal land and coastal borders. So... has approximately equal land and coastal borders.It is bordering... So this is Egypt. Probably. It looks like part of Northern Africa. This picture is showing that it is bordering 3 countries by land and 2 bodies of water on several sides. I'm going to go with ... approximately equal. I mean... I don't know what approximately equal is supposed to mean. I'm going to go with false, because even the sides of this country shown do not look equal in water to land borders. "
33, 12, "Southern Africa working age population. Southern Africa working age populations. South Africa has the lowest proportion of the population under 15 of all African nations. So I can't know this from this graph because it shows working age population and it's asking for under 15. So I know there's a high birth rate, but... the age range is for countries in Africa. There's a higher population of younger individuals in Africa than there are of older demographics in other... The proportion from younger to older individuals in Africa is much higher than in other countries. So I can't tell from this graph showing the population between 25 and 54. Population percent. Southern Africa is on the South end of Africa. I'm going to go with false, because I don't think there's as much poverty in some other countries in Africa. Yes. I believe there's less poverty in South Africa, which would lead to people... lead to more births too... I'm going to go with false, after all that. "
## Participant 9 = userID 34
34, 1, "This statement is... hmm... Switzerland is one of three countries who get more than 30% from nuclear power plants. Once again, I'm going to go with true. Like, I'm not 100% sure on this at all, but I feel that nuclear power is really where the world is heading, and I feel like Switzerland and many other European countries like Germany... western European countries like Germany and Italy are leading that movement."
34, 2, "I feel like this question is like, it should be like an obvious true, but at the same time I feel like it may be tricking me, there's like that other country with the really long border that I'm not thinking of off the top of my head. Plus, you know pretty much every question I've answered so far, which isn't a lot, only two, has been true, so I'm inclined to pick false, but based on what I know about countries, like Russia is a massive country. I'm just going to go false. When I picture Russia's map, it is a big country, but. Yeah, actually, Russia doesn't have that big of a coastal border. Most of Eastern Asia is occupied by China, at least like the coastal areas, so I'm just going to say false for that."
34, 3, "Black sea is somewhere near the Mediterranean/the Middle East. Yeah, that seems about right. I definitely don't know all the countries in the middle east, but seven countries could definitely border the black sea, so I'll say true for that."
34, 4, "OK, not entirely sure why they have this graph here. Population of European nations. Not sure why this graph is here. I'm just going to ignore that. Hmm. I mean, there's like I'd say 14-15 countries in South America, and I feel like at least 3 of them could possibly get at least 50% of their electricity from hydroelectric generation. At the same time, most of the countries in South America are developing. Actually, I feel that would be more of a reason why they would. OK, I'm picking a lot of true... Hmm. I'm just going to pick true. In hindsight, that may have been wrong"
34, 5, "Now I just feel obligated to say false. "
34, 6, "Again, ... Beijing China, except clearly none of the names of the locations in this map are Chinese whatsoever. Anyways, Paraguay is landlocked. I think that's true."
34, 7, "Finally, a picture that actually relates to the question. Hmm. One, two, three. I think Brazil might be a little bit higher up than the 5th largest country, at least based on this map. Russia, Canada, China, ... then the United States... 1, 2, 3, 4, and actually that looks about right. True statement."
34, 8, "I feel like I'm supposed to associate something with these pictures. Like, not necessarily leading towards the right answer, but possibly tricking me to associate Belize with poverty because they're showing all of these African countries. Less than 85% of the population of Belize... OK, that does not sound true at all. Way too high of a percentage. I'll say false"
34, 9, "Yeah, that sounds true."
34, 10, "OK, so where is Egypt. It's in Northern Africa. I feel like Egypt has one coastal border and about 2-3 land borders, so I'm going to say false for that."
34, 11, "South Africa has the lowest proportion of the population under 15... lowest proportion of the population under 15. So what I think this question is saying is that compared to most countries, it has a lower number of population under 15. So I'm going to say false. I feel like that may be a little bit of lazy thinking on my part, because I'm not processing the question as much as I should be, but whatever. submit."
34, 12, "This is a Middle Eastern country, so we're likely to think that women like don't work as much compared to men. But I feel that Qatar is one of those developing Middle Eastern countries that, you know, like Iran had actually more female college graduates than male college graduates or something. I feel it wouldn't be the largest... not even paying attention to the graphic by the way, because it has nothing to do with the question."

35, 1, "It's showing a map of Melbourne, Australia for some reason? Not sure how that's supposed to be related. OK, Brazil is really big, trying to think of what's bigger... I think it might be... hmm. Brazil is really big, Russia, Canada, the united states are really big too. I'm trying to think... I guess China. I'm not sure how all of their sizes compare. That might be true, I guess. I could see that being true. So I'll put true for Brazil being the 5th largest country."
35, 2, "And the image for this is a Toronto Maple Leaf's hockey player. Not sure that's really going to help at all. Eswatini. I don't really know where that is, but it kinda sounds like it might be in Eastern Europe or Africa maybe. I can't think of too many of those countries that only have one neighboring country. It's all pretty ... no, I can't. That doesn't make sense. If it's either of those places, I don't think... it wouldn't have only one bordering country. They're all crowded areas. That one's going to be false."
35, 3, "And the image is a salinity of Eurasian bodies of water graph, showing the salinity for the Atlantic Ocean, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and Red Sea. Trying to think of how that might help. Seven countries border the black sea. So I guess the Black Sea is not as salty as the Atlantic Ocean, Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and it's saltier than the Baltic Sea, Caspian Sea... Not sure if that really helps me though. ...muttering... I think that might be the sea by the middle east, kinda by the Middle East, between the Middle East and Europe. Sounds like a lot of countries would be bordering it though, and I don't think it is very big. So I think this one might be false, just cause that sounds like a lot of countries for how big I thought the body of water was."
35, 4, "And here, below that it has an image showing different European countries and their population over 65. Age wise. Population over 65 or is that... population density and Belgium... muttering... Then Belgium's over... Belgium's one of the green ones. I think Belgium is in this 15-20 portion. 95%. That sounds like a lot. Belgium. I think of Belgium, I don't think big cities, though. I think I might... This one's false. It doesn't really... I don't think of big urban cities when I think of Belgium. I think I'll put false."
35, 5, "There is a graph showing the percentage of nuclear for a bunch of European nations. Switzerland's over here with Scandinavian stuff. Sweden, Finland has some, Norway by Sweden... north of Germany maybe? Switzerland... I don't think any of the countries I think could be Switzerland have 0% nuclear according to the map. So I don't think that's true. There are only 2 spots on the map that have this red indicating that it's... I guess pink too. Finland's up there, Switzerland is up there closer to Sweden and Norway, so I think this statement is going to be false."
35, 6, "The picture is like a building that I think is in Europe, or Russia, but I don't think that matters. As far as the coastal border, I can see that being true, I think. There's ... uh, the whole north side I thought was just water. But then Canada's got a lot of coast too, so I think it would probably come down to Canada or Russia. Hmm. Canada... Canada has it on all sides except Alaska and the US... Russia has just the north I thought, the east as well. This one I guess I could see it being true, but I could also see Alaska having a coastal border. But... I think it probably makes more sense that Russia would have the longest coastal border. So I'll put true."
35, 7, "Again, I don't really know where Paraguay is exactly. Paraguay. I guess it's in South America, in South America it's probably land locked. It's in South America... Europe. If it's in Europe it's probably landlocked, but if it's in south america it might be more likely to be coastal. lot of coastal countries in South America? Paraguay. I think it's in South America. If it's in South america or central america, it's probably coastal, so I'll put false for this statement."
35, 8, "Huh. The image is just a chart showing Japan's imports in 2017, so I don't think that matters. Qatar, that's kind of by China. Discrepancy... For this one I don't even really know if I have anything in my head to try and base like an educated guess off of, but... I don't know. Hmm. Is it a Middle Eastern country? I guess it's a middle eastern country that's more progressive that might be true, but I don't know. I'm going to put false, just because it seems like it's more likely to be false than true."
35, 9, "There is a map showing the fossil fuel electrical generation in Central America. Shows what percentage of power comes from fossil fuels, so for Belize the percentage of power is like 60% or so. That doesn't really tell me how much power they have necessarily, but I guess since it's not as wealthy of a nation it might not have many alternatives besides fossil fuels. What other options are there even? Nuclear power, wind, hydroelectricity, and solar. I don't think Belize is rich, so they're probably relying on fossil fuels. 85% is a huge proportion... Central American nation, so I guess I don't know I thought Central American countries had more people with power than that. 15% with power seems like a really low amount. I think that one might be false, seems like a really low amount of the population to have electricity."
35, 10, "Huh. I think Egypt just has a coast on the Dead sea, red sea, or Caspian sea like that. The other sides might be connected to the Mediterranean? I can picture in my head what it looks like on a map. I thought Egypt had a lot of land border, I guess it has a lot of coastal border too, but... oh no, it's connected from the south too, northwest and north or something. I could see this one being true. I think the south has quite a bit of water access as well, and the north, so I think this statement might be true. "
35, 11, "The image is a graph showing electrical generation in South America, with the by percent is from electrical generation. OK, so what percent of the power is from hydroelectric. So more than 3 get more than 50% from hydroelectric, it's claiming that 3 get more than 50% from hydroelectric. On the graph, it looks like Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Paraguay all get more than 50%, so it looks like 4, so it'll be false. But I guess it's still true that 3 get that many but, it seems like a weird way to phrase that statement. So 4 have that many, but it's still true that 3 south american countries get more than 50%, because 4 do, so true."
35, 12, "Hmm. What would that suggest? That people don't live very long in South Africa I guess? South Africa is the best off of the South African countries... Lowest proportion would mean that more live long, lowest proportion under 15. And that South Africa is well off, relatively, I thought. So this could be true. This one's true because South Africa is better off than a lot of African countries. Check... OK, yes, I think this one's going to be true."

36, 1, "I don't really have any thought process to this, but that sounds possible."
36, 2, "Yeah, I know that's true, so."
36, 3, "Largest 10 countries in Africa by total area, so I don't know how that has anything to do with borders the Black Sea. This says there are 10 countries in Africa, but this doesn't have anything to do with that."
36, 4, "This one doesn't have anything to do with it either, it doesn't look like. Length of the region doesn't have anything to do with populations under age 15. So I'm going to be guessing again. "
36, 5, "There's Belgium, there's some areas. I have ridden a train through Belgium. I don't remember it being very rural or urban. That seems kind of high. I'm going to go with false."
36, 6, "Eswatini? Here's their population. I have no idea where this is at, but I know they have a lot of young people."
36, 7, "Coastal. They're right there but they have all that water. I don't know how big the other part is. I'm going with false."

36, 9, "That doesn't sound like something Switzerland would do, but I don't really know either. I've never been to Switzerland. I'm going to go with false. I've never read anything about nuclear power in Switzerland."
36, 10, "This shows me the population of Europe. So... 3 south american countries get more than 50% of their electricity from hydroelectric generation. If I looked at the other picture there seems to be a lot of moving water, so I'm going to go with true on that one."

36, 12, "Population with Electricity. Belize looks like ... This says population with electricity, so that seems like the opposite of what I just said."
# Participant 12 = userID 37
37, 1, "I'm saying that's false. Um. I don't know too much about Belize. I wanted to travel abroad there, but I do know that it's part of Southern South America. It's like the environment itself doesn't have much electricity, because it's a foresty environment."
37, 2, "Um, I would have to go with false, since, I feel like Africa there's more population and crowded with children and all that, lack of utilities. Um. Seeing the percentages how it shows, I feel like if it was given an actual date that would be more relevant. "
37, 3, "I'd say false. Um. It says approximately equal land, but with who, we don't know. It could vary. It needs to be a bit more specific."
37, 4, "I'd say true. Despite a lot of tourists going there, it is not overly crowded. There's a lot of people who live there."
37, 5, "Not knowing too much about Paraguay (is that how you say it?) Not knowing too much about it, I'd say partially. So yes. Seeing these animals, it makes it seem like maybe they once were endangered, like they sorta locked down the place from people. "
37, 6, "(Read statement as Over 90% of) .... Seeing the map and the color range, I'll have to go with yes. So with the population in urban areas, and it's the darkest"
37, 7, "With this bar graphs, it just states population of the united states and populations in millions with male and female. It doesn't give us more information on Switzerland, so I'm going to go with false."
37, 8, "(Read Swaziland as Switzerland) I'm going with false. Um, trying to remember back, I believe it borders part of Italy, France, and either Russia or some Asian country."
37, 9, "Umm. Hmm. With the chart, it has to do with working age men and women. The chart shows something to do with electricity. It doesn't really relate to the question, so I'm going with false."
37, 10, "Umm. I'd say true. I mean, seeing all of the hydroelectric power plants with all the circles indicating the capacity, Umm, there's certain areas that have multiple capacities, so... they should get a lot more. But I still feel like the entire diagram is partially white, and it says 50%, so I'm feeling like there should be a lot more circles of purple than white."
37, 11, "I'll probably have to go with true, seeing how the graph indicates black sea nations, and length of black sea coastlines indicates seven different countries, so going with true."
37, 12, "It indicates longest coastal border. Yet the chart indicates percentage of population and ethnic makeup, which in my opinion doesn't really contribute to the question. Two different pieces of information. So I'm going with false."
# Participant 13 = userID 38
38, 1, "Uh, never been to Egypt and I'm really bad at geography but, I don't think it has coastal borders, I'm pretty sure it's on the inside of Africa. So I'm going to say false."
38, 2, "Lowest proportion of the population. I don't really know what it means when it says lowest proportion of the population, if it's talking about different kinds of people maybe? I think South Africa is kind of big, so I'm going to go with true."
38, 3, "I don't even know where Belgium is, I think it's somewhere in Europe. I've never heard of a large town from Belgium, so I feel like it's pretty rural so I'm going to go with false."
38, 4, "It gives me a graph of India's ethnic makeup which in no way relates to Russia, but... coastal border. I'm pretty sure Russia is an interior country, so I'm going to go with false."
38, 5, "Umm. It gives a graph of Eswatini's border regions, with length on one side and two different countries, South Africa and Mozambique. So it looks like according to the graph, it borders two countries, South Africa and Mozambique, so False."
38, 6, "Let's see... there's a graph that says middle east population percent aged 25-54. Assuming the graph is correct, uh, so I know that Qatar is in the Middle East, and they're kinda sexist over there I believe, so I'm going to go with false. true. my bad. true."
38, 7, "With a picture of a kangaroo looking thing... Uh, Brazil. I'm going to go with false, because there's other countries, china Russia, I think the united states is bigger, Canada, hmm... yeah."
38, 8, "The graph says hydroelectric power generation in south america, percent hydro power. (muttering). According to the graph you'd have to be the bluish color and the darker blue. There are more than 3 countries that have 50%, assuming the graph is true. I don't know anything else about hydroelectric generation, so I'm going to trust the graph and go with true."
38, 9, "with a picture of Africa. I don't even know where the black sea is located. 7 countries. Well, there's a lot of smaller countries in Africa, and it looks on the left side... hmm. I'm going to go with true. "
38, 10, "There's a graph with electrical generation in Europe. There's a Switzerland bar. Nuclear power plants is orange, so it looks like it's between 40 and 60%, oh wait. Switzerland. It's less than 20%. Nuclear power. Less than 20. So false, assuming the graph is true."
38, 11, "With a graph of electricity access in central america, rural and urban. So if we look at Belize, it looks like... looks like everyone has access to electricity in Belize, it just denotes whether it's rural or urban. So false."
38, 12, "Should know this because I did a presentation on Paraguay in high school. There's a graph of Paraguay's population, which is completely unrelated to the question. I can picture Paraguay in my head, but I can't think of where it's at in South America so I'm going to say true."
# Participant 14 = userID 39
39, 1, "Umm, is this that same country? I don't know any of these. Those look like probably a similar language. I have no reason to deny if this is true or false, because I can't really tell. I'm going to say it's probably true. I cannot identify any of these towns, but assuming it's part of this, but I see ocean water, so if there's ocean water and it's probably part of that, it's only bordering one country. Seems reasonable."
39, 2, "the black sea... then, I can't count the countries. no country lines. There is a river there... that's probably one country divide. So reasonably, it looks like lot of different countries want to share the water, can you fit more than 7? I can see one, two, ... about 6 logical natural divides in the land, that doesn't always mean that a country will follow that. If I can count 6 countries with natural divides along those lines, I would say 7 is definitely reasonable."
39, 3, "OK. Well, exports don't do anything with that, so this is straight up logic I have to know. Well, I guess the question pins on population size or area mass. China and Russia are pretty huge, Canada is pretty large as well. I know Brazil is really big too... is it the 5th largest? So I can definitely count China Russia Canada I'm pretty sure is bigger. That's 3. If I can get one more that I know is bigger not smaller, then Brazil would be the 5th by logic. The US has a fair size, but I think the US is probably bigger. India I know has a really large population, but Canada's a lot smaller. Depending on population or country size, I think Brazil would be the 5th largest land mass size, but not population size. I'm assuming they want land mass, so I'm going to say it's probably true. I can't think of something else that would be bigger, India... Brazil is probably the 5th largest country."
39, 4, "Most countries would have a large amount of people in urban areas. You can find a large amount of people in urban compared to rural areas, which cannot house as many, they have more space and less population for that size. Over 95%... that would assume Belgium is not a large farming area. Or they're really compact cities. Either way... looking at the map I do see a large amount of towns marked. Looks like those are ... they have that small part on the south east side which is pretty open... I'm assuming that the large amount of cities in Belgium and that they have higher population densities that 95% of Belgium's population lives in urban areas."
39, 5, "Length of the world's longest border. Land vs. coast. Russia has the longest coastal, in blue, well under Canada's in length. That would be false, judging from this map. Canada clearly has the world's longest coastal, according to this map here. So that statement is definitely false. There's a lot more blue in Canada than there is in Russia, length wise. False."
39, 6, "Alright. Belize is that nice one up top north of Guatemala. The percentage of electricity is in the dark, so that is over 90% of the population with electricity in Belize. So they're saying less than 85% of the population has access to electricity, the graph purple color is showing that it is easily over 90 and definitely 100 for sure, so I would say this is false because over 90% has access to electricity."
39, 7, "So Egypt. I know it's at the northern tip. Border size. Coast compared to land borders. Don't know much about the geography of Egypt, but I know it's got... from what I can remember it has two sides kinda squarish not bordering Africa and two sides bordering Africa, so it probably has about 50/50 half a side and half aside equivalent of borders so I'd say yeah. that's a true statement. it's about 50/50. 2/4ths of a square."
39, 8, "Largest discrepancy, the largest difference from the proportion of working men and working women compared to other countries. So that's the male proportion of the population of that age group, and ... it, well compared to the united Arab... everything around it seems pretty light blue and white. Largest discrepancy between the proportion... I ... that's just the male proportion is what the graph shows. I don't see anything about... it definitely looks like there's a higher proportion of men in Qatar, that's definitely the darkest blue. Everything around it is pretty close at least closer to the 50 mark. I believe it has the largest discrepancy compared to the neighboring countries."
39, 9, "Three get more than 50% from hydroelectric generation. Let's see. I'm assuming it would have to be somewhat industrialized south american countries to get at least 50% hydroelectricity they would have to have a constant source of flowing water, so pretty big rivers. I know Amazon is a big one, definitely flows mostly through Brazil, but that river doesn't ... there's a lot more Brazil than there is amazon river, so that would be hard. I don't see Brazil actually doing that. From what I know about south america, not as industrialized as the us, and they do have a lot of rivers so it'd be possible for them to do something like that. For the smaller countries, I guess, with the rivers, that'd be a nice easy way. 3 smaller countries could get more than 50% from hydroelectric generation. I can't see the bigger ones, but 3 smaller ones, yeah, there's plenty of rivers in south america and small country size could make it doable. "
39, 10, "Ooh. Nuclear power is definitely good, and I know Europe is definitely into the ... into wind, i know they're into green power. 3 countries. Nuclear is definitely on the up and age upcoming definitely really popular. I don't feel like... one of 3 countries that gets more than 30% of power from nuclear power plants. Hmm. I don't know whether I want to believe that or not. You have nuclear is definitely new, but it does provide a large amount of energy, making it easy for it to get 30% of its power from nuclear plants. Europe is definitely a country that likes to go green, so do I believe that it's one of 3 that gets more than 30... again, they are smaller countries over in Europe than in the United States, so it is logical for a nuclear plant to provide a large amount of power, and it is new on the end 3 countries is a low amount of smaller countries to get at least 30% from a nuclear power plant because it does generate a lot of electricity."
39, 11, "OK, so. South Africa has the lowest proportion of the population, so they have the lowest ratio of the people under the age of 15 of all of Africa. Anything I know about South Africa that would relate to that. OK. Umm. Don't know anything about south Africa really. But. Logically, it's saying that they have if this statement were true, South Africa would be the lowest proportion of people under 15 of all Africa. That could be due to low childhood survival rates, or due to older people moving out or in or out of the country. So if they had the lowest proportion of the population under 15, they would have like a baby boomer kind of thing, they wouldn't be able to continue the economy very well, but I do not have anything any logical statements to say it's true. Considering I don't know anything any reason why it would be true, so I can assume it's false."
39, 12, "Well, there's a graph of China's population, which has nothing to do with Paraguay that I am aware. Paraguay I'm pretty sure is not north american. Uhh. I don't know this country at all, but it's not in Antarctica or North America, that's two facts, not on those continents. Umm. Doesn't sound like it's an African one. Paraguay I think is Latin america or south america possibly. if it's Latin america, the odds of it being landlocked is very small. And Brazil taking up most of the landmass, the odds of Paraguay being landlocked is very small. So assuming that Paraguay is in either southern or Latin america, then the majority of Latin america is definitely not landlocked. and south america they have pretty big countries and anything on the west coast is definitely not. So I'd say that Paraguay being landlocked is a false statement assuming that I'm correct that it's in south or Latin america, because there is not much land for it to be landlocked by."
