26, 1, "Well, OK, so, the picture says that more than three do; the picture says that one two three four five six, six countries get more than 50%, so. But it doesn't say only three countries, it says three south american countries get. It's a very broad, open ended statement in and of itself because it doesn't say only three. So I'm going to say that this one is true."
26, 2, "I love the picture. The picture is great. I feel like I might have read the last picture wrong. This one has absolutely nothing to do with the statement. But, nuclear power is still pretty new. I believe that Switzerland would probably be one of those countries that would make nuclear power just because it's clean energy and Switzerland is kind of odd like that. One of three countries. I don't think that there are three countries that get more than 30% of their power from nuclear power plants. so I'm going to go with False on that."
26, 3, "OK. Population. Qatar. I think that Qatar was one of the more progressive middle eastern countries, so I'm pretty sure that their neighboring countries are UAE and Saudi Arabia. So that's not true, Saudi Arabia... UAE definitely has a lot of working age women. I'm going to say that this one is false."
26, 4, "Perfect. Picture is India's ethnic makeup. So Russia borders the coast. They border the coast on the northern end and ... inaudible... which is also extremely large. But the entire continent of Australia is in the middle of the ocean and is one country. Russia is enormous, that's a lot of ocean. So I'm going to say this one is true."
26, 5, "This one is super, super false. That entire area is very underdeveloped. Just because of how underdeveloped central america is in most portions. The cities would obviously have electricity, but the rest of the population doesn't live in the city. I'm going to say... I'll say this one's true. "
26, 6, "Nah, there's no way. Egypt has two, three different land borders. I believe, unless they only border two countries and one wraps around the bottom. I believe that Egypt has three different land borders, and then, they do have two coastal borders, but I don't think those coastal borders are very large. Unless. Cause they only have one outlet into the ocean, regardless, on the Nile. So I think this one is false."
26, 7, "This one sounds like it could be fairly true. Over 95%. I don't even know how many people Belgium has in it. Probably one to two million, somewhere in there. And a lot of Europe has ... a lot of Europe is very urban rural developed. So I'm going to say that this one is false."
26, 8, "Um. I don't know where that is. According to this chart, it says Swaziland's border regions and measures the length in km. South Africa has over 400, Mozambique has over 100. So unless this graph is lying to me like a jerk, this one has to be false."
26, 9, "Ah, shoot. Black Sea. The black sea, I believe, is this area, so then... I mean, ... inaudible..., Certainly has one, two, three, I feel like I was right about the Egypt one. I'm pretty confident about that. Seven countries. Seven countries, ..., Europe, ... no, I think that one's false. Europe in this area doesn't have a lot of countries. Italy sticking it's foot into that area, and there's not a lot of southern areas. I'm going to say that one is false."
26, 10, "OK, know it's not first, that's Russia. Alaska is the size of... the size of like everything. It's showing a wallaby. I'm super confused. Australia is also quite large, Australia, I believe is bigger than Brazil. I could see it's quite large. I'm going with true. It's large as a lot of countries out there. Brazil... those YouTube videos where they put Alaska over like everything. Going to go with True."
26, 11, "Paraguay is in Central america. I don't think that's landlocked. If I remember correctly, it has a coast. So I'm gonna go with false on this one."
26, 12, "Really niche... Huh. I think that this one is false. South Africa is I believe the most developed of all the African nations, which is partially why you hear about it so much, because they actually have a presence. And the more developed you are, the higher your youth population is going to be because they have increased odds of surviving both childbirth and being young. So I'm going to say this one is false."
## Participant 2 = userID 27
27, 1, "Well, so Belgium is a relatively small country in land mass, but I don't know how large their rural population is. The population density needed for over 95% of the population to be in urban areas. It's in northwestern Europe, so probably fairly heavily populated, umm... I just don't think the population density is high enough for there to be that many people inside the urban areas."
27, 2, "OK, so Qatar. I can't remember a lot about that country. It's fairly heavily based in the energy industry. Surrounding countries... only really bordering Saudi Arabia. I'm assuming because there's a fairly wide gender gap in men and women working, I don't know enough to say for sure, umm, but in the absence of anything to say otherwise, I'm going to say false."
27, 3, "Paraguay is landlocked... um. What does this graph have to do with it? Disregarding the graph, Paraguay is in Central/South America, um, I think I remember something about it having a navy, but I can't say for sure. Just because of the ratio of countries that border water vs. those that don't, I'm going to say true for this question."
27, 4, "Disregarding the graph, which doesn't seem to be related to this question at all, and considering I know almost nothing about the population of Belize, um, barring any access to further knowledge, I'm going to say false on this one, just due to the proportion of the world population that does have access to electricity."
27, 5, "Russia has a very large land mass, on the eastern border you have Siberia, border the pacific ocean, a bit of coastal border on the western side. Assuming that the graph is correct, Canada would have a longer border by far, which does make sense because they have full borders with both the Pacific and Atlantic ocean. So I'm going to say false to this statement."
27, 6, "I'm disregarding the map because it doesn't seem to be anywhere near Swaziland. Considering that I know pretty much nothing about the geographic location of Swaziland. I'm going to default to false, considering that most countries would have more than one country on their border."
27, 7, "Well, I know that there are multiple. I know that so there's Turkey to the South, um, Russia also has black sea holdings, and the Baltics, that would be Romania and others, I think the number should be somewhere around 7, so barring complete knowledge, I'm going to say this statement is true."
27, 8, "Um, the graph does not seem to be applicable to this. I know that Brazil has a fairly large land mass. I know it's smaller than Russia, the US, maybe China, Canada... Canada has a very large land mass too. So yeah, that sounds about right. This is true."
27, 9, "OK. Well, this is another one that I do not know a lot about. Um. I know that in some South American countries, oil is a very large industry, but I don't know if they use that oil to generate electricity or if they just sell it. Um. I know there's a lot of water flowing rivers down there, so it's possible. Um. Suppose there are a large number of ...inaudible... well, no, South America, not central. Barring other information, I'm going to say this is false, just because that I haven't heard of such feats going on in South America, but that doesn't mean it is impossible."
27, 10, "So I know Egypt is a nation int he north east part of Africa. It has a northern border to the Mediterranean. It has an eastern border to the bit of water that runs to the Suez canal. That sounds about right, because it has land borders to the south and west, and sea borders to the north and east, so I'm going to say this statement is true."
27, 11, "OK, well this is another subject that I do not know much about. I haven't heard much about nuclear power in Switzerland. It's possible, I mean they have the technological and industrial ability to do it, it's a fairly small country, so it could get a fair amount of it's power from nuclear power. Given that nuclear power is a fairly well founded means of generating power, especially in Europe, I'm going to say this one is true, barring further information."
27, 12, "So I'm going to take this question to mean that they have the... um. that they're in the bottom 15 of population density. For like, proportion per land mass, and not any other thing they could be compared against. Um. I know that South Africa is fairly populous, and if we're going by land mass, I don't think they'd be that far down there for the proportion of population to land. Um, so I'm going to put this one as false. "
## Participant 3 = userID 28
28, 1, "So one is at 100 for hydroelectric, that's Paraguay. Ecuador is the same way, and Brazil is the same way, so that is true."
28, 2, "Um, I can't tell whether that's true or not. It shows a picture of one nuclear power plant. So I'll say that's false."
28, 3, "The graph has to do with religion, so it's false."
28, 4, "I would say that it would be surprising if that was true, so it's false."
28, 5, "Um, the graph is about Australia's exports. I would say that it's the United states... no, China, India, the united states, I'd say Brazil is the largest country."
28, 6, "That's a pretty small country, so that's pretty reasonable to say. So true."
28, 7, "Uh, it's a pretty wealthy African country... lowest proportion of the population under 15. Um, that would make sense then, because it'd have a lot more older people than other countries would."
28, 8, "Qatar is surrounded. It's in the middle east. I wouldn't say there's any reason for that to be true. Other countries around it would have the same discrepancy. So that's false."
28, 9, "Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, Ukraine, um, I would say that's false. There's less than seven. "
28, 10, "Paraguay... it's uh it shows the length of the borders and the coastline is zero, so it would be landlocked."
28, 11, "It's completely surrounded by a country, so yes, it's only bordered by one country."
28, 12, "Well, out of any country. It borders the pacific. Uh. Longest coastal border. Only other country I can think of would be like Canada. I'd say Russia's probably has the longest. "
## Participant 4 = userID 29
29, 1, "Um, I'm fairly certain that Belgium has quite a few rural areas, but I guess it could make sense... no, almost entirely positive that it's not 95%. It's probably closer to 75% lives in urban areas."
29, 2, "Given by the map, Qatar is next to Saudi Arabia. I've got a pretty solid feeling that Saudi Arabia has a larger discrepancy in the proportion between men and women. Is that what the question is asking? Is the difference between men and women working? Or the number of men to women working? OK, just wanted to double check. "
29, 3, "It's on the eastern side of Europe. Pretty sure it's less than seven countries that border the Black Sea. I'm not very good at geography. It was never my strong subject. false."
29, 4, "This picture doesn't quite go with the question, but, other than that. I'm fairly certain that it has more land borders than coastal borders. Yeah, approximately equal. It's kinda shaped like a rectangle, and the top side and the other side are ... two sides are water and two sides are land."
29, 5, "Umm. Well, no. There's one, two. Yay, I can count."
29, 6, "Brazil is the 5th largest country. One two three four five, look at that. Yay!"
29, 7, "It's Beijing. Hmm. It's labeled Beijing, China. There's the Paraguay river. Whoops. I can't remember where Paraguay is. I mean, I know it's in South America. No, it's on the east northern border of South America. "
29, 8, "Is this under the age of 15? OK, just wanted to double check. Proportion. Hmm. I want to say no, but I don't have a reason for it."
29, 9, "That cat's really cute. It's not helpful, but he's cute. Hmm. Switzerland's pretty little. I'm thinking yeah, totally. Accept it. "
29, 10, "Chile is a yes. Brazil is probably a yes. Hmm. True, I guess."
29, 11, "Yes, true. because there are umm. Well, I'm fairly certain that it's that large of a percentage that has... wait, yes. I mean. yes. that's right. "
29, 12, "I mean, it's a big-ass country. Yes. "
## Participant 5 = userID 30
30, 1, "Um. I don't even see... South Africa. Oh! Wait... Monaco. South Africa isn't even on this graph, so it doesn't border France. Right? Yeah. Proportion of the population under 15 of all African nations. Wait, this graph doesn't ... laughs... South Africa has the lowest portion of the population under 15 of all African nations. So this graph has nothing to do with it. Under 15 of all African nations. I thought South Africa had a big population, so I'm going to go with false."
30, 2, "None of these graphs have... wait, oh, wait, maybe it does. Yeah, this one does. Wait. No, it doesn't have anything to do with it. This graph is about salt salinity of the water, not which countries border it. So, the black sea is moderate in salinity, but I'm going to go... My knowledge of the Black Sea is very limited, so I'm going to say no... I'm going to say false, I don't think seven do."
30, 3, "Oh, that's hard. I don't think so. Cause, I feel like Brazil is one of the like most like developed... they're in the developing to developed countries. But then I feel like every other country is either like worse off than them, and they're not really good with renewable energy, especially not with their new president. So, I'm going to say, I'm going to say... ooh, but hydroelectric... I'm going to say false, cause I don't think that would be something in their infrastructure. "
30, 4, "Um, this map doesn't help much. What do we know about Paraguay? I don't think it is. Cause, I believe it's in Central America, and most of those have some form of water on either side. I'm going to go false."
30, 5, "This graph, this graph is of Australia. So it doesn't help. But, Russia's the first, then Australia, or China, Canada's pretty big, so that's four. So it's either that or another one. What country would be bigger? I'm going to go true. I feel like Brazil is pretty big. If it's not the 5th it's in the top ten. I'm going to go true."
30, 6, "I don't know what Swaziland is. So that doesn't... Um. Swaziland. Well, I feel bad. Wow. Cause I don't know anything about it, I'm going to say true. No, should I say false? This one's like 50/50, it's true or false and I'm not sure. So I'm going to go... I'm going to say false. No, I'm going to go true. I'm going to go true."
30, 7, "Belgium. That seems like a really high percentage. I feel like you have to have rural areas in your country. Like over 5%. I'm going to go false. I feel like that's just insane, like for an entire country to be entirely urban? False."
30, 8, "Egypt's border regions. Oh, wait. This one. This graph actually correlates with what I believe. So it's almost 2500, 1125, 1000, Yeah. I'm going to say this is true. Cause the graph. Yeah. If this is all the coastal borders, which I don't really know Egypt's borders. So I'm going to assume this is true, because I think the graph is representing what it wants me to look at."
30, 9, "Population demographics. Working... lower rate... I don't know if these graphs have anything to do with working. Working age men and women... It does have to do with gender, and ages. So other than it not saying... oh, working age. Working age is 18 to ... 18 to like. I don't know. I'm going to just look at these graphs and try to figure it out. Qatar has the largest... I don't know where Qatar is... Oh yeah, 25 - 54, that's probably working age. This is true. That was probably harder than it should have been."
30, 10, "Hmm. I'm going to go with true. I know that electricity... like, Belize is a developing country, so electricity is probably something that they lack, with regards to the entire population. Less than 85%, that's like 15 or less that actually do. And Belize is a small country. I'm still going to say true, because I feel like... I'm leaning towards true, just cause I know, er I don't know I assume they have a lot of work to do with electricity for people."
30, 11, "OK, this graph doesn't have anything to do with it, because it's about population and age, not energy. 30% isn't that much. Yeah, go true. They probably. Mmh it is... I'm still going true, just because Switzerland sustainable energy."
30, 12, "Coastal border. Oh, coastline. This key does not help me, though. It doesn't tell me if 1 is a lot of coast length or a little. So it's a 4, which means it isn't even the longest - it would be a 1 or a 5. I'm going to assume 1 is the longest... Oh, maybe they're ranked. They're probably ranked. OK, it's not. So, that's like no."
