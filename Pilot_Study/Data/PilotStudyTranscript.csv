## Participant 1 = userID 26
26, 1, "Well, OK, so, the picture says that more than three do; the picture says that one two three four five six, six countries get more than 50%, so. But it doesn't say only three countries, it says three South American countries get. It's a very broad, open ended statement in and of itself because it doesn't say only three. So I'm going to say that this one is true."
26, 2, "I love the picture. The picture is great. I feel like I might have read the last picture wrong. This one has absolutely nothing to do with the statement. But, nuclear power is still pretty new. I believe that Switzerland would probably be one of those countries that would make nuclear power just because it's clean energy and Switzerland is kind of odd like that. One of three countries. I don't think that there are three countries that get more than 30% of their power from nuclear power plants. So I'm going to go with False on that."
26, 3, "OK. Population. Qatar. I think that Qatar was one of the more progressive middle eastern countries, so I'm pretty sure that their neighboring countries are UAE and Saudi Arabia. So that's not true, Saudi Arabia... UAE definitely has a lot of working age women. I'm going to say that this one is false."
26, 4, "Perfect. Picture is India's ethnic makeup. So Russia borders the coast. They border the coast on the northern end and ... inaudible... which is also extremely large. But the entire continent of Australia is in the middle of the ocean and is one country. Russia is enormous, that's a lot of ocean. So I'm going to say this one is true."
26, 5, "This one is super, super false. That entire area is very underdeveloped. Just because of how underdeveloped central america is in most portions. The cities would obviously have electricity, but the rest of the population doesn't live in the city. I'm going to say... I'll say this one's true. "
26, 6, "Nah, there's no way. Egypt has two, three different land borders. I believe, unless they only border two countries and one wraps around the bottom. I believe that Egypt has three different land borders, and then, they do have two coastal borders, but I don't think those coastal borders are very large. Unless. Cause they only have one outlet into the ocean, regardless, on the Nile. So I think this one is false."
26, 7, "This one sounds like it could be fairly true. Over 95%. I don't even know how many people Belgium has in it. Probably one to two million, somewhere in there. And a lot of Europe has ... a lot of Europe is very urban rural developed. So I'm going to say that this one is false."
26, 8, "Um. I don't know where that is. According to this chart, it says Swaziland's border regions and measures the length in km. South Africa has over 400, Mozambique has over 100. So unless this graph is lying to me like a jerk, this one has to be false."
26, 9, "Ah, shoot. Black Sea. The black sea, I believe, is this area, so then... I mean, ... inaudible..., Certainly has one, two, three, I feel like I was right about the Egypt one. I'm pretty confident about that. Seven countries. Seven countries, ..., Europe, ... no, I think that one's false. Europe in this area doesn't have a lot of countries. Italy sticking it's foot into that area, and there's not a lot of southern areas. I'm going to say that one is false."
26, 10, "OK, know it's not first, that's Russia. Alaska is the size of... the size of like everything. It's showing a wallaby. I'm super confused. Australia is also quite large, Australia, I believe is bigger than Brazil. I could see it's quite large. I'm going with true. It's large as a lot of countries out there. Brazil... those YouTube videos where they put Alaska over like everything. Going to go with True."
26, 11, "Paraguay is in Central america. I don't think that's landlocked. If I remember correctly, it has a coast. So I'm gonna go with false on this one."
26, 12, "Really niche... Huh. I think that this one is false. South Africa is I believe the most developed of all the African nations, which is partially why you hear about it so much, because they actually have a presence. And the more developed you are, the higher your youth population is going to be because they have increased odds of surviving both childbirth and being young. So I'm going to say this one is false."
## Participant 2 = userID 27
27, 1, "Well, so Belgium is a relatively small country in land mass, but I don't know how large their rural population is. The population density needed for over 95% of the population to be in urban areas. It's in northwestern Europe, so probably fairly heavily populated, umm... I just don't think the population density is high enough for there to be that many people inside the urban areas."
27, 2, "OK, so Qatar. I can't remember a lot about that country. It's fairly heavily based in the energy industry. Surrounding countries... only really bordering Saudi Arabia. I'm assuming because there's a fairly wide gender gap in men and women working, I don't know enough to say for sure, umm, but in the absence of anything to say otherwise, I'm going to say false."
27, 3, "Paraguay is landlocked... um. What does this graph have to do with it? Disregarding the graph, Paraguay is in Central/South America, um, I think I remember something about it having a navy, but I can't say for sure. Just because of the ratio of countries that border water vs. those that don't, I'm going to say true for this question."
27, 4, "Disregarding the graph, which doesn't seem to be related to this question at all, and considering I know almost nothing about the population of Belize, um, barring any access to further knowledge, I'm going to say false on this one, just due to the proportion of the world population that does have access to electricity."
27, 5, "Russia has a very large land mass, on the eastern border you have Siberia, border the pacific ocean, a bit of coastal border on the western side. Assuming that the graph is correct, Canada would have a longer border by far, which does make sense because they have full borders with both the Pacific and Atlantic ocean. So I'm going to say false to this statement."
27, 6, "I'm disregarding the map because it doesn't seem to be anywhere near Swaziland. Considering that I know pretty much nothing about the geographic location of Swaziland. I'm going to default to false, considering that most countries would have more than one country on their border."
27, 7, "Well, I know that there are multiple. I know that so there's Turkey to the South, um, Russia also has black sea holdings, and the Baltics, that would be Romania and others, I think the number should be somewhere around 7, so barring complete knowledge, I'm going to say this statement is true."
27, 8, "Um, the graph does not seem to be applicable to this. I know that Brazil has a fairly large land mass. I know it's smaller than Russia, the US, maybe China, Canada... Canada has a very large land mass too. So yeah, that sounds about right. This is true."
27, 9, "OK. Well, this is another one that I do not know a lot about. Um. I know that in some South American countries, oil is a very large industry, but I don't know if they use that oil to generate electricity or if they just sell it. Um. I know there's a lot of water flowing rivers down there, so it's possible. Um. Suppose there are a large number of ...inaudible... well, no, South America, not central. Barring other information, I'm going to say this is false, just because that I haven't heard of such feats going on in South America, but that doesn't mean it is impossible."
27, 10, "So I know Egypt is a nation int he north east part of Africa. It has a northern border to the Mediterranean. It has an eastern border to the bit of water that runs to the Suez canal. That sounds about right, because it has land borders to the south and west, and sea borders to the north and east, so I'm going to say this statement is true."
27, 11, "OK, well this is another subject that I do not know much about. I haven't heard much about nuclear power in Switzerland. It's possible, I mean they have the technological and industrial ability to do it, it's a fairly small country, so it could get a fair amount of it's power from nuclear power. Given that nuclear power is a fairly well founded means of generating power, especially in Europe, I'm going to say this one is true, barring further information."
27, 12, "So I'm going to take this question to mean that they have the... um. That they're in the bottom 15 of population density. For like, proportion per land mass, and not any other thing they could be compared against. Um. I know that South Africa is fairly populous, and if we're going by land mass, I don't think they'd be that far down there for the proportion of population to land. Um, so I'm going to put this one as false. "
## Participant 3 = userID 28
28, 1, "So one is at 100 for hydroelectric, that's Paraguay. Ecuador is the same way, and Brazil is the same way, so that is true."
28, 2, "Um, I can't tell whether that's true or not. It shows a picture of one nuclear power plant. So I'll say that's false."
28, 3, "The graph has to do with religion, so it's false."
28, 4, "I would say that it would be surprising if that was true, so it's false."
28, 5, "Um, the graph is about Australia's exports. I would say that it's the United states... no, China, India, the united states, I'd say Brazil is the largest country."
28, 6, "That's a pretty small country, so that's pretty reasonable to say. So true."
28, 7, "Uh, it's a pretty wealthy African country... lowest proportion of the population under 15. Um, that would make sense then, because it'd have a lot more older people than other countries would."
28, 8, "Qatar is surrounded. It's in the middle east. I wouldn't say there's any reason for that to be true. Other countries around it would have the same discrepancy. So that's false."
28, 9, "Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, Ukraine, um, I would say that's false. There's less than seven. "
28, 10, "Paraguay... it's uh it shows the length of the borders and the coastline is zero, so it would be landlocked."
28, 11, "It's completely surrounded by a country, so yes, it's only bordered by one country."
28, 12, "Well, out of any country. It borders the pacific. Uh. Longest coastal border. Only other country I can think of would be like Canada. I'd say Russia's probably has the longest. "
## Participant 4 = userID 29
29, 1, "Um, I'm fairly certain that Belgium has quite a few rural areas, but I guess it could make sense... no, almost entirely positive that it's not 95%. It's probably closer to 75% lives in urban areas."
29, 2, "Given by the map, Qatar is next to Saudi Arabia. I've got a pretty solid feeling that Saudi Arabia has a larger discrepancy in the proportion between men and women. Is that what the question is asking? Is the difference between men and women working? Or the number of men to women working? OK, just wanted to double check. "
29, 3, "It's on the eastern side of Europe. Pretty sure it's less than seven countries that border the Black Sea. I'm not very good at geography. It was never my strong subject. False."
29, 4, "This picture doesn't quite go with the question, but, other than that. I'm fairly certain that it has more land borders than coastal borders. Yeah, approximately equal. It's kinda shaped like a rectangle, and the top side and the other side are ... two sides are water and two sides are land."
29, 5, "Umm. Well, no. There's one, two. Yay, I can count."
29, 6, "Brazil is the 5th largest country. One two three four five, look at that. Yay!"
29, 7, "It's Beijing. Hmm. It's labeled Beijing, China. There's the Paraguay river. Whoops. I can't remember where Paraguay is. I mean, I know it's in South America. No, it's on the east northern border of South America. "
29, 8, "Is this under the age of 15? OK, just wanted to double check. Proportion. Hmm. I want to say no, but I don't have a reason for it."
29, 9, "That cat's really cute. It's not helpful, but he's cute. Hmm. Switzerland's pretty little. I'm thinking yeah, totally. Accept it. "
29, 10, "Chile is a yes. Brazil is probably a yes. Hmm. True, I guess."
29, 11, "Yes, true. Because there are umm. Well, I'm fairly certain that it's that large of a percentage that has... wait, yes. I mean. Yes. That's right. "
29, 12, "I mean, it's a big-ass country. Yes. "
## Participant 5 = userID 30
30, 1, "Um. I don't even see... South Africa. Oh! Wait... Monaco. South Africa isn't even on this graph, so it doesn't border France. Right? Yeah. Proportion of the population under 15 of all African nations. Wait, this graph doesn't ... laughs... South Africa has the lowest portion of the population under 15 of all African nations. So this graph has nothing to do with it. Under 15 of all African nations. I thought South Africa had a big population, so I'm going to go with false."
30, 2, "None of these graphs have... wait, oh, wait, maybe it does. Yeah, this one does. Wait. No, it doesn't have anything to do with it. This graph is about salt salinity of the water, not which countries border it. So, the black sea is moderate in salinity, but I'm going to go... My knowledge of the Black Sea is very limited, so I'm going to say no... I'm going to say false, I don't think seven do."
30, 3, "Oh, that's hard. I don't think so. Cause, I feel like Brazil is one of the like most like developed... they're in the developing to developed countries. But then I feel like every other country is either like worse off than them, and they're not really good with renewable energy, especially not with their new president. So, I'm going to say, I'm going to say... ooh, but hydroelectric... I'm going to say false, cause I don't think that would be something in their infrastructure. "
30, 4, "Um, this map doesn't help much. What do we know about Paraguay? I don't think it is. Cause, I believe it's in Central America, and most of those have some form of water on either side. I'm going to go false."
30, 5, "This graph, this graph is of Australia. So it doesn't help. But, Russia's the first, then Australia, or China, Canada's pretty big, so that's four. So it's either that or another one. What country would be bigger? I'm going to go true. I feel like Brazil is pretty big. If it's not the 5th it's in the top ten. I'm going to go true."
30, 6, "I don't know what Swaziland is. So that doesn't... Um. Swaziland. Well, I feel bad. Wow. Cause I don't know anything about it, I'm going to say true. No, should I say false? This one's like 50/50, it's true or false and I'm not sure. So I'm going to go... I'm going to say false. No, I'm going to go true. I'm going to go true."
30, 7, "Belgium. That seems like a really high percentage. I feel like you have to have rural areas in your country. Like over 5%. I'm going to go false. I feel like that's just insane, like for an entire country to be entirely urban? False."
30, 8, "Egypt's border regions. Oh, wait. This one. This graph actually correlates with what I believe. So it's almost 2500, 1125, 1000, Yeah. I'm going to say this is true. Cause the graph. Yeah. If this is all the coastal borders, which I don't really know Egypt's borders. So I'm going to assume this is true, because I think the graph is representing what it wants me to look at."
30, 9, "Population demographics. Working... lower rate... I don't know if these graphs have anything to do with working. Working age men and women... It does have to do with gender, and ages. So other than it not saying... oh, working age. Working age is 18 to ... 18 to like. I don't know. I'm going to just look at these graphs and try to figure it out. Qatar has the largest... I don't know where Qatar is... Oh yeah, 25 - 54, that's probably working age. This is true. That was probably harder than it should have been."
30, 10, "Hmm. I'm going to go with true. I know that electricity... like, Belize is a developing country, so electricity is probably something that they lack, with regards to the entire population. Less than 85%, that's like 15 or less that actually do. And Belize is a small country. I'm still going to say true, because I feel like... I'm leaning towards true, just cause I know, er I don't know I assume they have a lot of work to do with electricity for people."
30, 11, "OK, this graph doesn't have anything to do with it, because it's about population and age, not energy. 30% isn't that much. Yeah, go true. They probably. Mmh it is... I'm still going true, just because Switzerland sustainable energy."
30, 12, "Coastal border. Oh, coastline. This key does not help me, though. It doesn't tell me if 1 is a lot of coast length or a little. So it's a 4, which means it isn't even the longest - it would be a 1 or a 5. I'm going to assume 1 is the longest... Oh, maybe they're ranked. They're probably ranked. OK, it's not. So, that's like no."
## Participant 6 = userID 31
31, 1, "Yes, if that is Paraguay."
31, 2, "Count 1, 2, 3, ish, 4, 5, 6. So false"
31, 3, "Nice picture of a dam. Um. Three, that seems reasonable."
31, 4, "I do not know, I'm going to have to guess that it's true."
31, 5, "Um. I think that's true... a lot of people live in urban areas."
31, 6, "This graph has nothing to do with the question. OK, um, more than 30%... I think that's true. "
31, 7, "I think it borders two. That's false."
31, 8, "Yeah, this graph does not have anything to do with electricity. That's false. Wait, less than... that's probably true. "
31, 9, "That seems pretty true. Russia is pretty big."
31, 10, "Hmm. Yeah, I think that's true."
31, 11, "The lowest... no, that's false"
31, 12, "This is not Egypt. Um. Approximately equal land and coastal borders. I don't think so. "
## Participant 7 = userID 32
32, 1, "Umm, I would say that's probably true. I don't have reasoning to suggest otherwise. I don't really know much about South American countries, but."
32, 2, "I think that's true. From what I remember from my geography days"
32, 3, "I think that's false. 85% is a pretty high number to not have access to electricity."
32, 4, "I think that might be true. Hmm. I'm not sure why my reasoning. I'm just. I don't really have any reasoning otherwise, but it sounds like it might be correct."
32, 5, "That's false, cause there's two countries around it in the picture at least."
32, 6, "I think that's true, from what I can remember from a South America map"
32, 7, "I think that's false. Umm. Because I know ... I'm pretty sure South Africa has a pretty large population, so I think that would be false."
32, 8, "Umm. From the graph it looks like it's false. It looks like it's under 20%. So I think that's false."
32, 9, "Umm. I think that might be true. It kind of looks like it could be equal on the map. "
32, 10, "Umm. I would say that's true. Russia is a pretty big country, so possibly. I think so. "
32, 11, "Umm. True, maybe. I think it might be true because I think most people  in Europe live in more urban areas, so I think that might be correct."
32, 12, "I think that's false. I think there's ... I think some of the other countries would be a little bit bigger."
## Participant 8 = userID 33
33, 1, "Brazil is a country. Brazil is very large. It is in South America. I am thinking that there's Russia, Canada, United States, Australia, Antarctica. So I will go with true. That seems true."
33, 2, "I'm not seeing a year, so I'm guessing that is currently. I don't know much about what's going on with Belize at the moment. The demographics show... The bar chart shows that the population type (rural or urban) with the percent electrical access out of 100. This doesn't tell me what percent of Belize's population has electricity, so I'm not going to use this graph. It does have a difference between countries and .... what? Some of the countries don't show 100% with electrical access, so either there's a space outside of rural and urban that isn't accounted for, or essentially 100% has access to electricity in Belize. I'm guessing it's not less than 85% just because that's irration... not irrational, but not likely, unless there was something major happened recently. I'm going to go with false."
33, 3, "OK. Percent of population at the bottom, age ranges. Once again, this doesn't tell me anything about where Belgium's population lives. It doesn't even list Belgium on the side as one of the countries. So. Demographics in Southern Europe. Yeah, this is useless. Uh, I'm going to go with... urban areas. No, Belgium is... I don't know much about Belgium. I was thinking of Lithuania... no, Luxembourg. A tiny country where it's all urban. I'm going to say that not over 95% of Belgium's population lives in urban areas. It does have some large cities, but I'm going to say most of it is still people spread throughout, even though it is a smaller country. I'm going to go with false."
33, 4, "So I know that globes are ... and this is a globe map I'm being shown... are stretched out towards the middle equator rather than being even across. So it looks strange. Just thinking of any country. Uh. It's not asking percent wise, so this would be in distance. Uh. That could be true. Canada has a lot of coastal border, and so does Australia. Russia is very large. And I can't think of hmm. I can't think of another country that has essentially a large portion of its mass in a peninsula. So this is probably true."
33, 5, "With a picture of the United States, Mexico and Canada. North America. (reading fact again) So. I have no idea which countries get power from nuclear power plants. Recently, I've seen that power plants are getting shut down slowly, being put out of use. I don't recall if any were in Switzerland, but I don't believe that's the case. Gets more than 30% of their power from nuclear power plants. I do not know. But. I'm going to go with no, just because ... 30% seems like quite a bit to be getting from nuclear power plants alone, but they do provide quite a bit of power. I don't know how many they have, and I haven't heard of there being nuclear power plants in Switzerland, so I'm going to go with false."
33, 6, "China's population. Not helpful. Paraguay. South America. I think it's to the east of northern Peru. So that would make it landlocked. I'm going to go with true."
33, 7, "I have never heard of this country, unless I'm forgetting it. It looks... If it's in Africa that could be the case. It looks like an African country name. Only borders one country. That's a weird sentence. It looks like Eswatini is part of Swaziland, which would probably make it not a country. I'm going to go with false because of that."
33, 8, "The black sea is in southern Europe. Seven countries. I'm going to say Spain, I don't know which countries are bordering the black sea. There are at least 4 or 5 around that area that I know, on the west to east end on the north side. I don't know if the black sea extends into African countries, to border African countries. I'm betting that's at least two countries. Going with true."
33, 9, "Qatar. Qatar is in eastern Europe, right? Let me think... yes. East. Yes. The largest discrepancy between the proportion of working age men and women compared to neighboring countries. Largest discrepancy between the proportion of working age men and women. So the difference between men and women working age, not working. It doesn't say anything about people working. Compared to neighboring countries. With a picture of a city. Which is to lead me to believe it's a large city. I would be looking at populations in the city. The United States having a large population is close to 50%, and most countries are close. I want to say Some African countries have higher rates of birth for one gender over the other. I can't remember which way that goes. 17 seconds. I'm going to go with ... false because I don't know enough. I'm just going to say false."
33, 10, "So once again population for South American countries, which is closer to correct but tells me nothing about electricity generated from hydroelectric generators. I seriously doubt that it's higher than 50% for just hydroelectric generation, especially for 3 different countries. They'd have to... I'm assuming they'd have strong river throughout all of it, and it can't be Brazil, because the size of Brazil is just too large. Even though there are many, many rivers through Brazil, I don't think they're utilizing hydroelectricity for 50% of the power needed. I'm going to go with false, because that seems like too much energy from hydroelectric."
33, 11, "Has approximately equal land and coastal borders to what? Equal land and coastal borders. Um. Equal land to coastal borders? Yeah, equal land and coastal borders. So... has approximately equal land and coastal borders.It is bordering... So this is Egypt. Probably. It looks like part of Northern Africa. This picture is showing that it is bordering 3 countries by land and 2 bodies of water on several sides. I'm going to go with ... approximately equal. I mean... I don't know what approximately equal is supposed to mean. I'm going to go with false, because even the sides of this country shown do not look equal in water to land borders. "
33, 12, "Southern Africa working age population. Southern Africa working age populations. South Africa has the lowest proportion of the population under 15 of all African nations. So I can't know this from this graph because it shows working age population and it's asking for under 15. So I know there's a high birth rate, but... the age range is for countries in Africa. There's a higher population of younger individuals in Africa than there are of older demographics in other... The proportion from younger to older individuals in Africa is much higher than in other countries. So I can't tell from this graph showing the population between 25 and 54. Population percent. Southern Africa is on the South end of Africa. I'm going to go with false, because I don't think there's as much poverty in some other countries in Africa. Yes. I believe there's less poverty in South Africa, which would lead to people... lead to more births too... I'm going to go with false, after all that. "
## Participant 9 = userID 34
34, 1, "This statement is... hmm... Switzerland is one of three countries who get more than 30% from nuclear power plants. Once again, I'm going to go with true. Like, I'm not 100% sure on this at all, but I feel that nuclear power is really where the world is heading, and I feel like Switzerland and many other European countries like Germany... western European countries like Germany and Italy are leading that movement."
34, 2, "I feel like this question is like, it should be like an obvious true, but at the same time I feel like it may be tricking me, there's like that other country with the really long border that I'm not thinking of off the top of my head. Plus, you know pretty much every question I've answered so far, which isn't a lot, only two, has been true, so I'm inclined to pick false, but based on what I know about countries, like Russia is a massive country. I'm just going to go false. When I picture Russia's map, it is a big country, but. Yeah, actually, Russia doesn't have that big of a coastal border. Most of Eastern Asia is occupied by China, at least like the coastal areas, so I'm just going to say false for that."
34, 3, "Black sea is somewhere near the Mediterranean/the Middle East. Yeah, that seems about right. I definitely don't know all the countries in the middle east, but seven countries could definitely border the black sea, so I'll say true for that."
34, 4, "OK, not entirely sure why they have this graph here. Population of European nations. Not sure why this graph is here. I'm just going to ignore that. Hmm. I mean, there's like I'd say 14-15 countries in South America, and I feel like at least 3 of them could possibly get at least 50% of their electricity from hydroelectric generation. At the same time, most of the countries in South America are developing. Actually, I feel that would be more of a reason why they would. OK, I'm picking a lot of true... Hmm. I'm just going to pick true. In hindsight, that may have been wrong"
34, 5, "Now I just feel obligated to say false. "
34, 6, "Again, ... Beijing China, except clearly none of the names of the locations in this map are Chinese whatsoever. Anyways, Paraguay is landlocked. I think that's true."
34, 7, "Finally, a picture that actually relates to the question. Hmm. One, two, three. I think Brazil might be a little bit higher up than the 5th largest country, at least based on this map. Russia, Canada, China, ... then the United States... 1, 2, 3, 4, and actually that looks about right. True statement."
34, 8, "I feel like I'm supposed to associate something with these pictures. Like, not necessarily leading towards the right answer, but possibly tricking me to associate Belize with poverty because they're showing all of these African countries. Less than 85% of the population of Belize... OK, that does not sound true at all. Way too high of a percentage. I'll say false"
34, 9, "Yeah, that sounds true."
34, 10, "OK, so where is Egypt. It's in Northern Africa. I feel like Egypt has one coastal border and about 2-3 land borders, so I'm going to say false for that."
34, 11, "South Africa has the lowest proportion of the population under 15... lowest proportion of the population under 15. So what I think this question is saying is that compared to most countries, it has a lower number of population under 15. So I'm going to say false. I feel like that may be a little bit of lazy thinking on my part, because I'm not processing the question as much as I should be, but whatever. Submit."
34, 12, "This is a Middle Eastern country, so we're likely to think that women like don't work as much compared to men. But I feel that Qatar is one of those developing Middle Eastern countries that, you know, like Iran had actually more female college graduates than male college graduates or something. I feel it wouldn't be the largest... not even paying attention to the graphic by the way, because it has nothing to do with the question."

35, 1, "It's showing a map of Melbourne, Australia for some reason? Not sure how that's supposed to be related. OK, Brazil is really big, trying to think of what's bigger... I think it might be... hmm. Brazil is really big, Russia, Canada, the united states are really big too. I'm trying to think... I guess China. I'm not sure how all of their sizes compare. That might be true, I guess. I could see that being true. So I'll put true for Brazil being the 5th largest country."
35, 2, "And the image for this is a Toronto Maple Leaf's hockey player. Not sure that's really going to help at all. Eswatini. I don't really know where that is, but it kinda sounds like it might be in Eastern Europe or Africa maybe. I can't think of too many of those countries that only have one neighboring country. It's all pretty ... no, I can't. That doesn't make sense. If it's either of those places, I don't think... it wouldn't have only one bordering country. They're all crowded areas. That one's going to be false."
35, 3, "And the image is a salinity of Eurasian bodies of water graph, showing the salinity for the Atlantic Ocean, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and Red Sea. Trying to think of how that might help. Seven countries border the black sea. So I guess the Black Sea is not as salty as the Atlantic Ocean, Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and it's saltier than the Baltic Sea, Caspian Sea... Not sure if that really helps me though. ...muttering... I think that might be the sea by the middle east, kinda by the Middle East, between the Middle East and Europe. Sounds like a lot of countries would be bordering it though, and I don't think it is very big. So I think this one might be false, just cause that sounds like a lot of countries for how big I thought the body of water was."
35, 4, "And here, below that it has an image showing different European countries and their population over 65. Age wise. Population over 65 or is that... population density and Belgium... muttering... Then Belgium's over... Belgium's one of the green ones. I think Belgium is in this 15-20 portion. 95%. That sounds like a lot. Belgium. I think of Belgium, I don't think big cities, though. I think I might... This one's false. It doesn't really... I don't think of big urban cities when I think of Belgium. I think I'll put false."
35, 5, "There is a graph showing the percentage of nuclear for a bunch of European nations. Switzerland's over here with Scandinavian stuff. Sweden, Finland has some, Norway by Sweden... north of Germany maybe? Switzerland... I don't think any of the countries I think could be Switzerland have 0% nuclear according to the map. So I don't think that's true. There are only 2 spots on the map that have this red indicating that it's... I guess pink too. Finland's up there, Switzerland is up there closer to Sweden and Norway, so I think this statement is going to be false."
35, 6, "The picture is like a building that I think is in Europe, or Russia, but I don't think that matters. As far as the coastal border, I can see that being true, I think. There's ... uh, the whole north side I thought was just water. But then Canada's got a lot of coast too, so I think it would probably come down to Canada or Russia. Hmm. Canada... Canada has it on all sides except Alaska and the US... Russia has just the north I thought, the east as well. This one I guess I could see it being true, but I could also see Alaska having a coastal border. But... I think it probably makes more sense that Russia would have the longest coastal border. So I'll put true."
35, 7, "Again, I don't really know where Paraguay is exactly. Paraguay. I guess it's in South America, in South America it's probably land locked. It's in South America... Europe. If it's in Europe it's probably landlocked, but if it's in south america it might be more likely to be coastal. Lot of coastal countries in South America? Paraguay. I think it's in South America. If it's in South america or central america, it's probably coastal, so I'll put false for this statement."
35, 8, "Huh. The image is just a chart showing Japan's imports in 2017, so I don't think that matters. Qatar, that's kind of by China. Discrepancy... For this one I don't even really know if I have anything in my head to try and base like an educated guess off of, but... I don't know. Hmm. Is it a Middle Eastern country? I guess it's a middle eastern country that's more progressive that might be true, but I don't know. I'm going to put false, just because it seems like it's more likely to be false than true."
35, 9, "There is a map showing the fossil fuel electrical generation in Central America. Shows what percentage of power comes from fossil fuels, so for Belize the percentage of power is like 60% or so. That doesn't really tell me how much power they have necessarily, but I guess since it's not as wealthy of a nation it might not have many alternatives besides fossil fuels. What other options are there even? Nuclear power, wind, hydroelectricity, and solar. I don't think Belize is rich, so they're probably relying on fossil fuels. 85% is a huge proportion... Central American nation, so I guess I don't know I thought Central American countries had more people with power than that. 15% with power seems like a really low amount. I think that one might be false, seems like a really low amount of the population to have electricity."
35, 10, "Huh. I think Egypt just has a coast on the Dead sea, red sea, or Caspian sea like that. The other sides might be connected to the Mediterranean? I can picture in my head what it looks like on a map. I thought Egypt had a lot of land border, I guess it has a lot of coastal border too, but... oh no, it's connected from the south too, northwest and north or something. I could see this one being true. I think the south has quite a bit of water access as well, and the north, so I think this statement might be true. "
35, 11, "The image is a graph showing electrical generation in South America, with the by percent is from electrical generation. OK, so what percent of the power is from hydroelectric. So more than 3 get more than 50% from hydroelectric, it's claiming that 3 get more than 50% from hydroelectric. On the graph, it looks like Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Paraguay all get more than 50%, so it looks like 4, so it'll be false. But I guess it's still true that 3 get that many but, it seems like a weird way to phrase that statement. So 4 have that many, but it's still true that 3 South American countries get more than 50%, because 4 do, so true."
35, 12, "Hmm. What would that suggest? That people don't live very long in South Africa I guess? South Africa is the best off of the South African countries... Lowest proportion would mean that more live long, lowest proportion under 15. And that South Africa is well off, relatively, I thought. So this could be true. This one's true because South Africa is better off than a lot of African countries. Check... OK, yes, I think this one's going to be true."

37, 2, "Um, I would have to go with false, since, I feel like Africa there's more population and crowded with children and all that, lack of utilities. Um. Seeing the percentages how it shows, I feel like if it was given an actual date that would be more relevant. "

I mean, seeing all of the hydroelectric power plants with all the circles indicating the capacity, Umm, there's certain areas that have multiple capacities, so... they should get a lot more. But I still feel like the entire diagram is partially white, and it says 50%, so I'm feeling like there should be a lot more circles of purple than white."
37, 11, "I'll probably have to go with true, seeing how the graph indicates black sea nations, and length of black sea coastlines indicates seven different countries, so going with true."

# Participant 14 = userID 39
39, 1, "Umm, is this that same country? I don't know any of these. Those look like probably a similar language. I have no reason to deny if this is true or false, because I can't really tell. I'm going to say it's probably true. I cannot identify any of these towns, but assuming it's part of this, but I see ocean water, so if there's ocean water and it's probably part of that, it's only bordering one country. Seems reasonable."
39, 2, "the black sea... then, I can't count the countries. No country lines. There is a river there... that's probably one country divide. So reasonably, it looks like lot of different countries want to share the water, can you fit more than 7? I can see one, two, ... about 6 logical natural divides in the land, that doesn't always mean that a country will follow that. If I can count 6 countries with natural divides along those lines, I would say 7 is definitely reasonable."
39, 3, "OK. Well, exports don't do anything with that, so this is straight up logic I have to know. Well, I guess the question pins on population size or area mass. China and Russia are pretty huge, Canada is pretty large as well. I know Brazil is really big too... is it the 5th largest? So I can definitely count China Russia Canada I'm pretty sure is bigger. That's 3. If I can get one more that I know is bigger not smaller, then Brazil would be the 5th by logic. The US has a fair size, but I think the US is probably bigger. India I know has a really large population, but Canada's a lot smaller. Depending on population or country size, I think Brazil would be the 5th largest land mass size, but not population size. I'm assuming they want land mass, so I'm going to say it's probably true. I can't think of something else that would be bigger, India... Brazil is probably the 5th largest country."
39, 4, "Most countries would have a large amount of people in urban areas. You can find a large amount of people in urban compared to rural areas, which cannot house as many, they have more space and less population for that size. Over 95%... that would assume Belgium is not a large farming area. Or they're really compact cities. Either way... looking at the map I do see a large amount of towns marked. Looks like those are ... they have that small part on the south east side which is pretty open... I'm assuming that the large amount of cities in Belgium and that they have higher population densities that 95% of Belgium's population lives in urban areas."
39, 5, "Length of the world's longest border. Land vs. coast. Russia has the longest coastal, in blue, well under Canada's in length. That would be false, judging from this map. Canada clearly has the world's longest coastal, according to this map here. So that statement is definitely false. There's a lot more blue in Canada than there is in Russia, length wise. False."
39, 6, "Alright. Belize is that nice one up top north of Guatemala. The percentage of electricity is in the dark, so that is over 90% of the population with electricity in Belize. So they're saying less than 85% of the population has access to electricity, the graph purple color is showing that it is easily over 90 and definitely 100 for sure, so I would say this is false because over 90% has access to electricity."
39, 7, "So Egypt. I know it's at the northern tip. Border size. Coast compared to land borders. Don't know much about the geography of Egypt, but I know it's got... from what I can remember it has two sides kinda squarish not bordering Africa and two sides bordering Africa, so it probably has about 50/50 half a side and half aside equivalent of borders so I'd say yeah. That's a true statement. It's about 50/50. 2/4ths of a square."
39, 8, "Largest discrepancy, the largest difference from the proportion of working men and working women compared to other countries. So that's the male proportion of the population of that age group, and ... it, well compared to the united Arab... everything around it seems pretty light blue and white. Largest discrepancy between the proportion... I ... that's just the male proportion is what the graph shows. I don't see anything about... it definitely looks like there's a higher proportion of men in Qatar, that's definitely the darkest blue. Everything around it is pretty close at least closer to the 50 mark. I believe it has the largest discrepancy compared to the neighboring countries."
39, 9, "Three get more than 50% from hydroelectric generation. Let's see. I'm assuming it would have to be somewhat industrialized South American countries to get at least 50% hydroelectricity they would have to have a constant source of flowing water, so pretty big rivers. I know Amazon is a big one, definitely flows mostly through Brazil, but that river doesn't ... there's a lot more Brazil than there is amazon river, so that would be hard. I don't see Brazil actually doing that. From what I know about south america, not as industrialized as the us, and they do have a lot of rivers so it'd be possible for them to do something like that. For the smaller countries, I guess, with the rivers, that'd be a nice easy way. 3 smaller countries could get more than 50% from hydroelectric generation. I can't see the bigger ones, but 3 smaller ones, yeah, there's plenty of rivers in south america and small country size could make it doable. "
39, 10, "Ooh. Nuclear power is definitely good, and I know Europe is definitely into the ... into wind, i know they're into green power. 3 countries. Nuclear is definitely on the up and age upcoming definitely really popular. I don't feel like... one of 3 countries that gets more than 30% of power from nuclear power plants. Hmm. I don't know whether I want to believe that or not. You have nuclear is definitely new, but it does provide a large amount of energy, making it easy for it to get 30% of its power from nuclear plants. Europe is definitely a country that likes to go green, so do I believe that it's one of 3 that gets more than 30... again, they are smaller countries over in Europe than in the United States, so it is logical for a nuclear plant to provide a large amount of power, and it is new on the end 3 countries is a low amount of smaller countries to get at least 30% from a nuclear power plant because it does generate a lot of electricity."
39, 11, "OK, so. South Africa has the lowest proportion of the population, so they have the lowest ratio of the people under the age of 15 of all of Africa. Anything I know about South Africa that would relate to that. OK. Umm. Don't know anything about South Africa really. But. Logically, it's saying that they have if this statement were true, South Africa would be the lowest proportion of people under 15 of all Africa. That could be due to low childhood survival rates, or due to older people moving out or in or out of the country. So if they had the lowest proportion of the population under 15, they would have like a baby boomer kind of thing, they wouldn't be able to continue the economy very well, but I do not have anything any logical statements to say it's true. Considering I don't know anything any reason why it would be true, so I can assume it's false."
39, 12, "Well, there's a graph of China's population, which has nothing to do with Paraguay that I am aware. Paraguay I'm pretty sure is not north american. Uh. I don't know this country at all, but it's not in Antarctica or North America, that's two facts, not on those continents. Umm. Doesn't sound like it's an African one. Paraguay I think is Latin america or south america possibly. If it's Latin america, the odds of it being landlocked is very small. And Brazil taking up most of the landmass, the odds of Paraguay being landlocked is very small. So assuming that Paraguay is in either southern or Latin america, then the majority of Latin america is definitely not landlocked. And south america they have pretty big countries and anything on the west coast is definitely not. So I'd say that Paraguay being landlocked is a false statement assuming that I'm correct that it's in south or Latin america, because there is not much land for it to be landlocked by."

Well it's one of the more developed, it's actually not an underdeveloped country, so that might be true. Underdeveloped countries tend to have more youth because there isn't as much access to ... what do I want to say? ... birth control and whatnot."

41, 10, "OK. Qatar isn't shown there. I believe that's an African country. Discrepancy between working age men... so, that's the discrepancy between how many men and women are of working age. I... I don't know if that's a discrepancy, if there'd be much of a discrepancy because men and women tend to be birthed around the same rate, unless there's.... working age is younger or they don't... women live longer, but working age is around the time when they'd still be alive. I don't know how much of a discrepancy would be ... but I guess I'll go with true."
41, 11, "Umm, I guess Canada might be a contender against that, but ... thinking back to largest countries, that other question Russia was larger than Canada. So it's possible they have longer coastal border. I guess looking at that picture it's relevant to this question cause it shows the border, but...

42, 2, "And with this statement comes a bar chart comparing age and population in Switzerland. This bar chart has nothing to do with Switzerland's energy consumption and the source of their energy. I have no way of assessing whether or not this statement is true based on the evidence that is given. I guess I will conclude that Switzerland is one of three countries that get more than 30% of their power from nuclear power plants, based on their CERN superconductor and innovative technologies, so I will guess that that statement is true. "
42, 3, "With this statement I'm given a visualization of Middle Eastern population data, for ages 25-54. It's logical to assume that this is what they mean by working age. Looks like this visualization is a density visualization, and Qatar is the darkest of the surrounding countries. This visualization is only referring to the percentage of the population that is able to work and has nothing to do with the discrepancy between men and women. So I suppose I'm going to answer this statement as false, because I don't have any way of analyzing the discrepancy between men and women. "
42, 4, "At first glance, this seems to be a reasonable statement, as the Amazon river in South America flows through multiple countries, though I don't know those countries off the top of my head outside of Brazil. However within Brazil, knowing their political climate and the energy needs that nation would have, it's still reasonable to assume they'd get their electricity from the Amazon. Guess I'm lacking knowledge about the South American continent today. But I'm going to assess this statement as being true, just because of I know the Amazon's presence in South America definitely could provide multiple countries a source of electricity that would account for more than 50% of their electric, hydroelectric generation."
42, 5, "Umm. With this statement, once again, I'm not given a graphic of the African continent. I'm trying to recall from my freshman geography course in high school where Swaziland is located in Africa. My first guess is that this is the country enclosed within South Africa, however I am not confident in that. However, if that were the case it would in fact only border one country, and since I do not have a better guess as to where Swaziland is, outside of being enclosed in South Africa, I'm going to evaluate this statement as being true."
42, 6, "With this statement, I am provided a graphic. It shows the area in square kilometers of the largest 10 countries in Africa. The Black sea is not located in Africa, it is in western Asia. So I'm having to recall from memory the geography in that area, and whether or not seven countries border the black sea. Countries that come to mind would be Russia, perhaps the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, turkey, perhaps Georgia, perhaps Romania. I'm really not confident in my geographic understanding of the area surrounding the Black sea, but I do not feel like there are seven countries based on the general size of the nations in that part of the world, it seems unlikely that that body of water would have seven countries bordering it, so I'm going to evaluate that statement as false."
42, 7, "Uh, what do I know about Belgium? The Flemish reside in Belgium. Belgium is a nation north of France and south of the Netherlands, if I'm not mistaken. I know that Western Europe is a highly developed and urban part of the world relatively, however 95% seems to be an overwhelmingly high number considering that there are still lots of rural communities in Western Europe. Essentially, based on the hyperbole I feel that is present in this statement, 95% is much too high, so I'm going to evaluate this statement as false. However I was not provided any visual representation of data, I was only provided an image of what I believe was a city in Belgium."
42, 8, "With this statement I'm provided a graphic showing the length of Egypt's border regions. Coast accounts for less than 2500 km of border, if I were to combine Sudan's portion of Egypt's border with Libya, Israel's, and Gaza Strip's respectively, that would add up to roughly 1250 + 1100 + 200 + a really insignificant amount from the Gaza strip, so is 2400 greater than or equal to 1250 + 1100, it is approximately equal so I will evaluate this statement as approximately true."
42, 9, "With this statement I'm provided a graphic image of a lion feasting on a deceased animal. I believe this image has been presented to me to try and paint an image in my mind's eye of Belize as being an underdeveloped, struggling country. My understanding of Belize's government and society... I have no way of evaluating whether or not less than 85% of the people have access to electricity, but I'm hopeful that they do. I'm really not sure that lions live in Belize, to be honest. I don't think this image has anything to do with the statement, not just in that it's a lion, but I don't think lions live in Belize. I'm going to evaluate this statement as being false. Again, really don't have the information to back up that evaluation."
42, 10, "With this graphic I'm provided a world map with the ranking of the 5 countries with longest coastline. It appears Canada has the longest coastal border based on the graphic. The graphic doesn't have any sources, but based on the geography of northern Canada in the Arctic circle, there's a lot of islands and archipelagos and things of that nature, which would account for a lot of coastline, so I'm going to evaluate this statement as true... er, I meant to say false, the statement was talking about Russia."
42, 11, "Uh, with this graphic I'm provided France's border regions in km. This information is not pertinent to the statement about South Africa's population and the portion of the population that's under 15. Based on South Africa's history of um apartheid and political turmoil following all of that, demographics in South Africa are unique when you compare them to all African nations, I wouldn't necessarily say they would have the lowest proportion of the population under 15. It would make sense that more developed nations have a more balanced population distribution... it's generally poorly performing economic countries that have high proportions of populations at a young age, if there's not access to birth control and the birth rate is very high. I'm going to evaluate this statement as being true, though I wasn't provided any pertinent information, I think you can make a case for this statement being logical. "
42, 12, "I was provided a map of Melbourne, Australia. Melbourne, Australia is of course not in Brazil. Also the wording of the statement is ineffective, as largest could refer to geography, population, there's different ways of evaluating the largeness of a country. In land mass, I think it is fair to say Brazil is the fifth largest country in land mass, behind Russia, China, Canada, and the United States respectively. I'm going to evaluate this statement as being true under the assumption that it is referring to land area, as that is what I think is the most logical interpretation of largest, because that is unclear. I'm going to sort of leave an asterisk by that true. "

43, 1, "I don't have any information. I don't know anything about this... how they get their power. Umm. The graph seems a little odd, since it's not connected with Switzerland. Umm. But it seems very specific, so I'm going to say true."
43, 2, "Ooh. I don't know this either. If this is Brazil, assuming that it's like the correct picture cause last one was a little odd and didn't connect with the claim, it looks pretty big. I would say true."
43, 3, "Oh, so it seems that the images just don't correlate with the statements. Cause this is an image of Mexico City. So I'm picturing Egypt right now, and if my mind is correct it has two borders of land and two of ocean, so I'm going to say true."
43, 4, "I feel like Russia is really big, but it has a lot of land border, so I'm going to say no."
43, 5, "I feel like this isn't the correct country that's highlighted, but I believe that Paraguay is in South America and I think it is landlocked. Like one of the countries that's in the middle, the upper one. I'm going to say true"
43, 6, "I think the Black Sea is in Europe/Middle Eastern area. I don't know how many countries there are that border it. I'm going to say true for this one."
43, 7, "Well, I'm thinking that South American countries are, a lot of them are surrounded by ocean, so it is possible that they get their electricity from hydroelectric generation. I don't know about hydroelectric generation, if they can use salt water or fresh water, but if it is salt water, I would say true."
43, 8, "So I was looking at the graph to see if it correlates, but I don't think it does either. This one just shows the percentage of the population. I would say, I feel like South Africa is pretty big, and it's pretty common to go there to volunteer and travel, so I would say false."
43, 9, "I know that Belize is a common place for Iowa State students to travel to for courses. I don't think they would send people there if it wasn't well populated, so I would say false."
43, 10, "I also don't know that. I'm going to say false, though, cause I feel like Belgium is city-like. Though that's just a guess, I don't know about that."
43, 11, "I believe Swaziland is the country that's in South Africa, so I'm going to say true, cause I think it's surrounded completely by South Africa."
43, 12, "OK, so I think Qatar is near Saudi Arabia, so from my knowledge I would think a lot of the men in Saudi Arabia work but not the women, so I would say this is false. "
## Participant 19 = userID 44
44, 1, "I actually think I already knew this. Based on the fact that Russia, Canada, United States, and China are all bigger, I'm going to go ahead and say that is true. Although Australia is throwing me off there, but I'm looking at the key to see that Australia is 6th, so that's true."
44, 2, "Umm. Based on this image here, I'm going to go ahead and say that is false, because there's this long inlet here that gives them a lot of coastal border along with this strip here, along with the other ones they have that aren't shown in this image."
44, 3, "I'm going to go ahead and say that is true. I'm not sure exactly what those countries are, but I know south america has a lot of big rivers that are easily converted to use hydroelectric energy, so true. "
44, 4, "I know the black sea is somewhere between Europe and Asia, and I'm not sure how many countries border it, and since seven is pretty specific, I'm going to go ahead and say that's false because I don't think that many border the black sea."
44, 5, "The largest discrepancy between the proportion of working age men and women. Does that mean there's a lot more working age men than women? I think that's what that means. And, I think because of the boom in their economy they're bringing in a lot of foreign workers, and that would make sense that most of them are men, because it's the Middle East and they're not quite progressive in that stance. So the statement is true."
44, 6, "Looking at the demographic, find Belgium down at the bottom, and this is just percentage of population based on age, so that doesn't tell us a lot about urbanization. Based of my knowledge of western Europe, I'm going to say...  but 95% is a little bit high for me, so I'm going to say false."
44, 7, "So this graphic is about Kenya, so that doesn't tell me a whole lot about Belize. I want to say that Belize is in South America and not Africa. I'm not 100% sure on that. If you look at the population of Kenya, ... this doesn't say anything about their access to electricity. We're just going to go ahead and say that's true, based on that I think Belize is in South America and they have access to electricity."
44, 8, "Well, first off, the map is of France. So that's really helpful to me. I'm going to say that statement is false, because South Africa is one of the most developed countries in Africa, and that means they would have a population of older individuals and not younger individuals because they have access to medicine, vaccines, that sort of thing."
44, 9, "That's true, it's right in the middle of South Africa here."
44, 10, "Umm. I think it does, cause it has a lot of... no, I don't think it does, it's like Finland or Sweden or something. Although Russia does have a very long coastline, it doesn't have as many indents as Finland or Sweden or something like that, so that statement is false."
44, 11, "There's a lot of... I know Paraguay is in the northern half of South America, but I'm not sure if it's landlocked or not. I know there's a lot of little countries at the top of South America there, and I think Paraguay could be one of them, so I'm going to go ahead and say this is false."
44, 12, "Let's see if we find Switzerland here. It says nuclear is below 20%, that's the orange category there, so that statement is false. "
## Participant 20 = userID 45
45, 1, "That is true, because it is in the m... it's surrounded by other countries, it's not by the ocean."
45, 2, "So, umm, this is population in millions, get more than 50% of their electricity, umm. Well there's only one country that... more than 50%... Hydroelectric generation. Well, I'm not really sure... while this graph is the population of the countries. I don't feel like they get more than 50% of their electricity from hydroelectric generation, because that sounds pretty technologically advanced, and I know many South American countries aren't there, they're like less developed countries, so I'm going to say false."
45, 3, "Southern Africa working age population... population... I'm guessing this is all of South Africa. Umm. The color is about like a between 50% and 60% is 25-54. Lowest proportion of the population under 15... Umm. There's more lighter colors of those."
45, 4, "Umm. Brazil is pretty big, but uh it kinda depends whether it's talking about population or land wise. Population, like, India, that's big, China's big, there's a lot more like African and Asian countries that are big. 5th, that's kinda down the list. That could be true. "
45, 5, "So, this is the demographics in Southern Europe, so... Belgium is I don't see it on here. Population... I don't see Belgium on here. Is Belgium, it's a country and these are countries. Belgium and Switzerland are... they're not... I think they're not by each other. They're like dutch, and chocolate, and there's dutch people there. So 95% lives in urban areas... umm, usually more people live in urban areas and the population of younger people under 54 in Switzerland is between 20 70 50%. I'm going to say that's false."
45, 6, "India's ethnic makeup, Dravidian, Mongolian, other, the percent of the population. I don't know what India has to do with Russia, but... Russia they do have a lot of, they are by the ocean, they are surrounded by ocean I'm pretty sure, but coastal border I don't hear people talk about going to the ocean in Russia, but they were in a lot of wars and they had boats, so I'm going to say that's true."
45, 7, "Umm, people talk about Switzerland, they talk about them being neutral, but I know they've had things to do with wars, and nuclear power is a big part of war, so the past wars, I'm not really sure where they're located, but I feel like they have something to do with nuclear power, so I'm going to say that's true."
45, 8, "Well, Belize is a less developed country, umm, percent of electrical access in Belize. Well, 100% have ... is that like 100% have access to electricity, so... depending on whether rural or urban, 100% have electrical access, so that's false."
45, 9, "Umm, never heard of Swaziland, but it sounds like an African country, so I'm going to say... Africa has a lot of countries, uh, I don't know if it's on the coast or landlocked, but it's probably bordering other countries, so false."
45, 10, "The black sea, I know it's either like by the Mediterranean sea, like middle eastern, or maybe in Africa. This picture looks like Greece in a way, but I don't think it's in Europe. Black sea... yeah, that sounds like. It's not a very popular sea, so maybe only 7 countries..."
45, 11, "Umm, I'm not sure if I'm looking at a picture of Egypt, but if I am, um, land and coastal borders, uh, well, that could be true if it is, because it's kinda like the shape of a square, and all 4 sides are equal on a square, so yeah, say that's true."
45, 12, "Umm, Qatar, that's middle eastern, and a lot of women don't have rights in middle eastern countries, so I feel like there's not a lot of working women compared to men, so I'm going to say that's false."
## Participant 21 = userID 46
46, 1, "Umm, That seems false to me. That seems like an over-estimate. But Belgium is a pretty small country, but I don't know if it's that urbanized - it might still be more of a rural setting. So I'm going to say false on that."
46, 2, "I'm going to go ahead and for that I'm thinking of countries in my head and I'm going to say false. I'm thinking Australia - it's a continent, but it's also a country, and it's an island, completely surrounded by coast."
46, 3, "Umm, that sounds true to me. That sounds like a true statement. I don't believe south america has a large wind, solar, natural gas, coal, but there is a lot of water. So I'm going to say true on that."
46, 4, "I'm going to say that's false. South Africa, from what I've seen in movies and talking to people, is one of the better parts of Africa. I'm going to say true, no. I'm going to stick with false."
46, 5, "OK, this is just a list of their imports. Transportation and machinery, umm, I'm going to go ahead and say true. Qatar I feel not 100% sure I'm going to go with the basis that middle eastern countries do have a larger discrepancy between the proportion of working age men and women."
46, 6, "I'm going to go with true - I'm picturing a risk map in my mind, and I think that's right."
46, 7, "Uh, I'll go ahead with true. I have no idea what this country is."
46, 8, "And Belize is not on the map that's given, umm, so again, I'm going to go ahead... say that's false. 85% is a really large number to have access to some form of electricity."
46, 9, "Umm, I'm going to go ahead and say that's true. I'm trying to picture the black sea in my mind right now and I feel like at least 7 countries have a bit on the black sea."
46, 10, "I'm thinking, trying to picture a map in my head with Paraguay on it, and I know it's in South America and next to Uruguay, but I don't know if it's landlocked or not, so I'm going to go with true."
46, 11, "It is a map of Australia's exports, umm... I'm going to go with true, uh, trying to think of it and guessing largest is in general mass size, the largest not in population or any particular export, so I'm going to go true with that"
46, 12, "It's a map of nuclear power plants in Europe, and if you look at Switzerland, which is over here... trying to find it on the map, not on there. OK, umm, I'm going to go with true, if I remember right, the super collider is in Switzerland, so that is probably going to need a lot of power."
## Participant 22 = userID 47
47, 1, "The salinity of Eurasian bodies of water, the statement is true or false. These are the seven countries that border the black sea, and their salinity. Uh. So we need some knowledge of the black sea and the salt content of it. Seven countries. Border the black sea. These are Eurasian bodies of water. I don't think the salinity has a whole lot to do with the countries that border the black sea, that would be prior knowledge. I'm also not sure where the black sea is, so I think this statement would be false"
47, 2, "This one seems more likely to be true. But we need to find the outside lengths of the borders. Egypt has approximately equal land and coastal borders, so there'd be equal land and water borders. That may be possible, given the water that's showing, so I'd say yes, this is true."
47, 3, "This is the electric generation in South America for various countries. Three South American countries get more than 50%, so that would be true, Paraguay, Ecuador, Colombia, and Brazil, which is more than 3."
47, 4, "We'd need to know all the countries that get more than 30% would be lighter red, seeing Finland, area below Austria, More than 30% would be red as well, so France. I'm having a bit of trouble remembering where Switzerland is, but I believe it is not one of the ones with more than 30%, so I'd say it is false."
47, 5, "This is definitely possibly true. But, South Africa has the lowest proportion of the population under 15 of all African nations, it probably has a lower birth rate due to it being colder, there's probably some warmer areas in South Africa. Umm, compared to other African nations. I don't have a whole lot of knowledge of their population either. Lowest proportion of the population under 15, it'd be probably the oldest nation. So I'd say true."
47, 6, "I don't have a whole lot of prior knowledge for the electricity access in Central America. They have the percent of power from fossil fuels, and they're showing like 55%, but I don't think that would give a whole lot of information as to whether your population has access to it, less than 85%, so probably 50% or more would be living in rural areas without direct access to electricity, so I would say that's true."
47, 7, "I'm thinking about a map of Russia, and other surrounding countries. I would say there would be more water access possibly to the top, but I have to see if that's fully connected. And besides would in some area, I'm thinking of other areas that would have longer... since the longest is not the largest... the longest coastal border. I'd say that's true, I'm having a tougher time finding larger countries to compare it with. "
47, 8, "We have an info graph of Japan's imports, so it doesn't add a whole lot of information. Possibly minerals and machinery, we'd have to look at Qatar's exports. And possibly... the different fields of work which would have more men and women, or possibly the culture of a place that would have working men and women. Going back to the Japan's imports, I don't think that's really adding a lot, after looking at it again. I'm also looking for other countries to compare it to, umm, not really coming up with a lot of countries. I mean it's possible that Qatar would have the largest, but I think there's other countries that would be greater than that, so I'm saying false."
47, 9, "These are the largest countries by total area, Russia, Canada, United States, China, Brazil being the 5th one. This info graph could be possibly missing other countries. My geography knowledge is not the greatest at this time. I'm trying to think of other areas that would be large, but these are the largest 10 countries, so it wouldn't skip out on any, so I would say this is true."
47, 10, "This requires some more geography knowledge. Some knowledge from a Spanish class taken a while back, so I'm thinking through the map. Trying to think if it was located north, east, south, or west. But without the map in front of me I'm having a tough time thinking of exactly where it is. There are a lot of countries that aren't landlocked due to it being surrounded by water, so I would say that it is not landlocked."
47, 11, "We have the Toronto Maple Leaves, possibly playing hockey. I'd say this requires some prior knowledge of which it borders, trying to picture where Swaziland is on the map, and... not really coming up with anything. Seems like an interesting question. Pick Swaziland specifically, being more obscure, or perhaps not depending on people's knowledge. I'd say this would be a neat property that it'd hold, that it only borders one property, so I'll say that it's true."
47, 12, "We have a population of over 65%. I think that 95% would be a very large population of urban area, but it'd also depend on the amount of non-urban area available to the country, so I'm trying to think of Belgium's size, perhaps its layout given farm land and other resources. I'd also have a tough time finding Belgium on a map, much less the urban areas. Due to it being 95%, I think of America having very large cities, they take up a lot, but I don't think it's all the way to 95% and I can't think of any large urban areas in Belgium, so the statement is false."
## Participant 23 = userID 48
48, 1, "I've seen a map of this area, I believe I've seen a map of this area. I know it's south of America. I'm not sure if there's other countries surrounding it, but ... the picture is kind of deceiving because it makes it seem like there is a body of water around it. I'm just going to say true, because  I know it has a lot of vegetation and a lot of warmth down there, so yeah. I just remember a geography class with that country in it, but I don't know much about it."
48, 2, "So an urban area would probably consist of roughly not a whole lot of population but something where there's still activity going on, and if over 95% of Belgium's population lives there then I think that's a pretty high statistic and not very accurate, I'm just going to say false to this one because it's a high percentage and although Belgium isn't that large, I still think it would be kinda impossible to have 95% of the population living in an urban area."
48, 3, "South Africa, I know some people from there and I know that it's mainly the white race that speak quite a lot of English, although there are many different ethnicities there, I do know that some actually some youth groups go there and do a lot of service and say there's many many people from an american descent, almost. So I would say that if South Africa has the lowest proportion of the population under 15, meaning they have the oldest, an older population that lives there, I would say true, just because it is a nice place to live, probably on the southern part of Africa, not too hot, and there's probably a lot of younger adults living in the central part of Africa."
48, 4, "Qatar... not sure how to say that. Umm. Has the largest discrepancy between men and women. Just based on the chart, I can see that the blue chart representing the males goes way higher than the females does, and that is probably the biggest gap I see in here, so just based on the chart and the different genders that I see, I'm going to select true."
48, 5, "Umm, I do know that it's big, and I do know some people from there as well. They say it is pretty populated, but when I read the sentence, and it says largest country, I wonder if that means in the world, or in South America. Just the 5th largest. When it says country, it makes me think that it's just based on the land, not the people. So I'm going to say false for that one, cause I know it's big but not extremely big. The 5th largest."
48, 6, "Russia. I do believe this one. And with, with just looking at a global map, you can see that Russia has a huge border, which means they would have to set that border along a long range of area, and I know it's located on the more Eastern side of the globe compared to the United States, and there's a lot more land over there, and you can definitely... I'll rate this one as true... the longest coastal border of any country. Yeah. Also I think Russia is mostly landlocked on the southern part, so I'll say true for that one."
48, 7, "Black Sea is over by Egypt, like Israel area. Umm. I don't know if they all border the Black sea, cause the black sea is ... I think it's small, it would be hard for 7 countries to border the black sea. So although it's giving me the largest countries in Africa, I don't think this has much to do with the Black Sea or what countries border the Black sea. Also, the countries that they give me are really really large. I would say it's less than 7 countries that border the black sea, based on the graph and previous experience learning about the black sea in geography class."
48, 8, "I do actually have to believe this because not all of it is created in these countries, some of it can be exported, and to say 50% of their electricity comes from hydroelectric generation, I would agree just knowing that Europe, a European nation is very economical friendly, learning about that, in in some of my classes now. They're doing their best to go back to the natural way and do things better for the environment, so I'm going to say true, although 50% is very high."
48, 9, "Umm, So it looks like there's a very young population there. Unfortunately, probably a lot of older people leave, either they leave or they're not surviving that long. To say that Swaziland only borders one country, that says there's only one way for people to really leave for travel by land, to go from Swaziland to the next... umm, just wondering why there's more young people than old people here and what happened to them. Cause I think that based on the fact that it has the name land in it, I would say that normally, from my experience it represents something that is not really surrounded by other countries, so I'm just going to say true for that one, and also with younger people they may not have access to good health, good healthcare for the old people, so they can survive longer."
48, 10, "Umm. Equal land and coastal borders. By coastal borders, I'm going to guess that refers to just some seas, cause I don't think there's any large bodies of water, unless you'd consider a sea a large body of water, ... but I don't know if it's equal. In the picture it does look pretty equal, I don't know just going off of the picture that would be reasonable, I think in order to actually give a true to this I would have to be 100% sure that when it says approximately equal land and coastal borders, it actually means half and half, half land and coastal borders. For this one I'm going to say false, not too sure that this could be accurate, although the land seems a lot larger than the coastal borders in the picture, I just can't be too sure about that one."
48, 11, "Umm, Switzerland likes to set itself apart from others, cause it's one of the Scandinavian countries. And I know that based on other maps I've seen... I do know that they like to stay away from nuclear power plants, and in fact, Switzerland isn't that big, so if it was one of three countries that get more than 30% of their power from nuclear power plants, I would say that that wouldn't be the case for Switzerland, that might be another country... even Russia would be more believable. I don't remember reading a lot or reading anything about nuclear power plants that were there, so I'm going to answer false. I'm not sure what 30% of their power plants would look like, I'm sure they get a lot from other sources as well. "
48, 12, "So I know where Belize is. I know it's a very, a very impoverished community, same with Nicaragua. I was traveling to Nicaragua last year, and I know that they don't have power lines, which means that it would be very hard for them to have electricity, but I do know that many of the kids there have access to computers, which is kind of interesting because that requires electricity, but when it says that less than 85% of the population of Belize has access to electricity, I... well, it says less than 85% of the population, so I would believe that, cause when something says less than 85%, it could be 50% or 65%. This is a pretty vague statistic, so I'm going to go with true, it could be anything less than that."
## Participant 24 = userID 49
49, 1, "Umm. I guess I don't really know that area that well, in Asia, but umm, it's giving me a picture of Russia, North Korea, China, Japan, but I don't see Qatar, which is odd. It's talking about its neighboring countries, but I don't really see the picture of it, so I guess I would say... it could be true. I think that the country isn't that advanced, and compared to North Korea, compared to that country, North Korea has a lot of stability, I guess, not like as a government standpoint, but I feel like women don't work as much as men in North Korea, cause they're very controlling of their population, so I'm probably going to say false. "
49, 2, "Considering I don't know what that word means, or ever heard of this country, and it's showing me Canada, I don't think it's Mexican and it doesn't sound like it, and it doesn't sound like a country either, but I'd definitely say it's not by Canada. And it's showing me the population of Canada, which is not relative, but I'd probably say false for this situation."
49, 3, "It's showing me a graph of ... five country and a state, unless Georgia is a country. Well, six countries, and it's talking about 7, and comparing the length of the black sea coastline, which I don't personally know how big it is, which would help me decide relatively how many countries are around it. I feel like if there are 7 countries that surround the black sea, they might include it in the graph. Some of this data, I'm going to say false."
49, 4, "I know umm a friend that went to Belize, and they talked about the country and how like it's not very... what's the word I'm looking for... advanced of a country. I know there's a lot of people that work in the hospitality kind of area, and I know that the nicest parts of their country are places where people go to travel, and that's where they make their money, but I would believe that 85%, maybe not that much, maybe 85% don't have access to electricity. I'm going to go with false... no, true."
49, 5, "Umm, urban vs. rural in a city? I don't really know what their living space looks like, but based off of the graph, they're pretty dark blue, and the graph says that percent population in urban areas and they're in the 95% to 100% category, so based off of the graph I would say that it's true."
49, 6, "There's a picture of panda bears. The picture's kind of distracting, but I would say... Oh my god I'm so bad at geography, this is not good. I would take an educated guess to say false, and that is based of no knowledge of geography, but I have  50/50 chance so that's what I'm going with."
49, 7, "I think I learned somewhere that Europe is very advanced in their alternate energies. I thought they were moving more towards wind power, but they could still be using nuclear power. Umm, based off of the graph, Switzerland looks like they fall under 20% of nuclear power, so I have to go with false."
49, 8, "The graph shows Russia's ethnic makeup and percent of population, so it has nothing to do with the question, so I wouldn't base it off of the map, er graph, but they're a pretty big country, so, I don't know what percentage of them is connected to the ocean, cause Australia has a lot of coast. I'm going to go with false."
49, 9, "pretty sure that's false, but... don't quote me. Umm. Based off where it is in Africa, I'd say that maybe 30%..."
49, 10, "Trying to think about, like, my international studies teacher talks about Brazil, cause that's where she's from. It is a big country, so is Russia. And the United States. Umm, I mean it sounds decent, I'd almost say it's like bigger than that, maybe like 4th or 3rd. I don't know. I'm going to say false."
49, 11, "Looking at the lowest proportion of the population under 15, the graph is talking about age distribution in southern Africa. Umm. Well, based off the graph, the Mauritius, they're population under 15 is a lot smaller than South Africa, so I wouldn't say it's the lowest. False."
49, 12, "This isn't showing percentage, on the map, but it does show circles of ... I don't know what MW stands for, but there are a lot of circles in Brazil. I would say maybe 2 tops, but definitely not 3, based off of the graph. "
## Participant 25 = userID 50
50, 1, "Umm, I don't really know if that's true or false, because there's a graph here that shows the population of Switzerland and it compares their genders and ages. I'm going to say that's false because there's not anything that would support that."
50, 2, "I have to say that's probably true. Belgium is kind of one of those countries that has a lot of cities, from what I know. So I feel like that could be pretty true; most people live in the city or near the city."
50, 3, "There's a graph that describes India's ethnic makeup, pretty unrelated. Russia is kind of on the ocean a lot, so they could have a lot of coastal border, but I don't know if they have the longest of any country, so I'm going to have to say that one is false."
50, 4, "I'm not going to lie, I don't know where the black sea is. This map doesn't really help me because the black sea isn't labeled, but it probably could be true, if the black sea is near here."
50, 5, "Uh, the graph... it's not really a graph more of a map, shows the percent of the population 25-54, which is typical working age for men and women. Based on the population of the other countries compared to Qatar, I'd say they probably would have more people working than neighboring countries, so I'd say that's true."
50, 6, "There's a map showing percent power from fossil fuels, and Belize has probably 25-50% I'd say, but that doesn't necessarily mean they have access to electricity in the general population, especially in Central American countries, so I would say this one is false. From what I know, Belize is a more of a poor country and they don't have as many electrical resources, so the population may not have as much access, even though a certain percentage doesn't necessarily mean how much electricity they have access to."
50, 7, "There's a graph showing hydroelectric power generation in South America, the percent hydro power for more than 3 countries is at least 50%, so that's true according to this map. No source, but it could be accurate."
50, 8, "Looks like a baby kangaroo picture, don't know why that is related, but Brazil is a pretty large country, it could be number 5, I'd say that's true."
50, 9, "Not entirely sure what this one is saying, but I'd say that's probably true, because I know South Africa is a pretty prominent part of South African nations."
50, 10, "I'd say that's probably true, Egypt is pretty close to the ocean from what I can remember, so... they probably have about half and half on the land and on the ocean borders."
50, 11, "There's a graph showing ... a bar chart showing border regions of South Africa and ... some other one, it says it only borders one country and I just don't think that's true, most countries border one other country, so I'll say that's false."
50, 12, "Shows their population, don't know, that's not really relevant. I'm thinking it probably isn't landlocked, from what I remember from my geographical history, so I'd say that's false. "
## Participant 26 = userID 51
51, 1, "OK. So, I have a map here, percent of the population 65 or older. Let's see. I'd say with almost a fifth of the population being older, I would imagine that this claim is false because of in general I picture older populations being in more rural areas. "
51, 2, "Alright, Border type, land, coast. So I think that this chart is saying it's not, it looks like Canada has the longest coastline based on coast to land. So I'm going to say this is false."
51, 3, "Um, I would say this is false based on what I know from geography, it's ... the northern side is coastal but the other sides are landlocked."
51, 4, "Largest discrepancy between the proportion of working age men and women than neighboring countries. Alright, so... 24, 54, so there's about 75% of the population working age, I'm guessing. Based on the proportion of males in that age range, I'd say that's true, based on the chart given."
51, 5, "So I'm not entirely sure about South Africa compared to other African nations, but I would guess this is false, I believe South Africa is one of the more developed countries, and so I think that would increase the average age of the population. Oh wait, has the lowest proportion. Oh. Umm, the lowest proportion, uh, I'd still say it's false, just based on the lowest ... it would end up somewhere in the middle."
51, 6, "Alright, percent with electrical access. OK, so according to this graph, it looks like 100% have access to electricity, so this statement is false."
51, 7, "Umm, I would guess especially when taking into account the smaller South American countries that could be true, based on the amount of support from larger countries that they get. "
51, 8, "I would say that could be true, based on Switzerland being highly developed and not having the same aversion to nuclear power that america does"
51, 9, "Brazil's export value... Uhh, can I ask if this is in regards to population or land mass? Brazil is the 5th largest country... I'd say that could be true. "
51, 10, "I'm not great on geography in that area. I'd say that could be true."
51, 11, "Paraguay is landlocked. There's China's population. Umm, I want to say Paraguay is not landlocked, but I'm not entirely sure. Based on..."
51, 12, "And then here's Toronto, Canada. I don't know about this one. Make ... I'd say that's false."
## Participant 27 = userID 52
52, 1, "False, because it's not an island, whereas other countries would have a lot more coastal border"
52, 2, "True, because it sounds true, but I don't know why"
52, 3, "True, because there's only one country in the map that's surrounding it"
52, 4, "I don't know that much about nuclear power plants, but going to say that's true"
52, 5, "Paraguay's border region... true, because there's nothing on the coast"
52, 6, "Umm, true, because there's a lot of blue dots in more than 3 areas."
52, 7, "That sounds like it would be true"
52, 8, "I'm just going to assume that is true"
52, 9, "That graph tells me nothing about the answer, so... I'm going to say false. That's talking about religion, so..."
52, 10, "One, two three, four, five, seven... True, because I just counted them."
52, 11, "True, most of the graph seems to be... actually false, looks like they're less than 95%"
52, 12, "This is talking about Australia, and I don't think Brazil is the 5th largest country."
## Participant 28 = userID 53
53, 1, "Umm, wait, this is a picture of China. Umm, oh gosh. Umm, that's in South America, Central America, South America. I believe there's an ocean next to it, I'm going to say false."
53, 2, "I don't know much about this country, but by the looks of it... it looks kind of poor. 85% is kind of a lot. I'm going to say true."
53, 3, "Uhh, let's see here. More than 50%, OK, that's true, because more than 3 are above 50."
53, 4, "Oh my gosh, Umm, I'm not sure where the Black Sea is, but I'm going to go with false."
53, 5, "Umm, I'm ... Switzerland seems kind of advanced, I'm going to say that's true, I don't really have a reason behind it. I'm not sure what that has to do with it."
53, 6, "Umm, OK. Umm. I know it's at the top of Africa, umm, I know there's some coastal borders. I'm going to say true."
53, 7, "Umm, Umm... I don't know. Lowest proportion of the population... Umm, I'm going to say false."
53, 8, "Umm, false. There are two countries."
53, 9, "Umm, that looks pretty long. I'm going to go with true."
53, 10, "Umm, one two three four five, yes that looks true."
53, 11, "Let's see... hmm, I'm going to say true, because that is a large difference."
53, 12, "Umm, so Belgium's in Germany, and ... I don't even know what Germany looks like. I'm going to say true."
## Participant 29 = userID 54
54, 1, "Umm, OK, so I know Brazil is in South America, I have no idea how big Brazil is, but I do know it is pretty big. 5th largest country, though, I don't know if I'd want to say that. I mean I know Russia's for sure gotta be in there. Mexico. OK, maybe it is in the 5th largest, cause I can't think of anything that would be larger. I guess I would say yes."
54, 2, "Huh. Hydroelectric generation, so maybe they're talking about dams, and like, so hydroelectric generation, so electricity from water, and in South America. I guess I would assume that that's true, because in South America, at least in areas that have a lot of river basins. They would use a lot of... I mean, from old classes, I guess, I've learned about hydroelectric generation, and in areas that have a lot of river basins. So I would... I would say that this is true. I feel like that makes sense, in my mind."
54, 3, "I have no idea where that is. Umm. Uhh. Only borders one country though, that would mean that it would have to... it's probably a coastal land, if it were to only border one country. So I guess what's the likelihood that that's a possibility? I'm going to say no, it doesn't seem... I would say false."
54, 4, "Umm, that seems kind of true to me. I mean... Belgium in Europe, I think, pretty sure, so I feel like it would make sense that most of the population lives in urban areas, though the only thing I can think of is like, I mean, kind of not really near that but in in in a sense maybe, I can think of Turkey, they have like over 90% of their population that lives in urban areas, and France also I think. So I mean I guess I wouldn't be surprised that over 95% of Belgium's population would live in an urban area. I'm going to say true."
54, 5, "So nuclear power plants, ... population of Switzerland vs. population in thousands in age... so 25-54. OK, so... most of the population is 25-54, i guess is what this graph is saying. So it's pretty equal between females and males, so... one of three countries that gets more than 30% of their power from nuclear power plants. I guess maybe I'm not sure what to think from the graph, but I guess if it's saying most of the population is within younger, kind of middle aged people, kind of demographic, I would think that that could be true, more than 30% of their power's from nuclear power plants. Sure, yeah."
54, 6, "So largest discrepancy between men and women... so ... population, percent population with electricity. Umm, I know that especially in this region there's a larger discrepancy between like men and women. So I mean, compared to neighboring countries, let's see, China, North Korea, Russia, South Korea, I wouldn't, I guess, I wouldn't know in comparison, but I would think it would have a larger discrepancy, I feel like that would make sense, at least, looking off of this off of this map, knowing that that area has a larger discrepancy as it is. So I would say yes."
54, 7, "OK, so landlocked, that means it's surrounded all by land, so no coastal areas. Paraguay, I feel like, I feel like I don't have much to back this up with, but I feel like I thought, I would have guessed with no knowledge that it I guess had contact with the ocean. I don't know, Paraguay, I just feel like I remember from some time, somewhere, I don't have a complete... this is more of a guess, I guess, but I would say false."
54, 8, "Length of the Black Sea coastline, Ukraine, Turkey, Romania, Georgia, Russia, Bulgaria, so that's six countries, so... and that shows I guess the length of the black sea coastline that they have, so I don't know if they're missing one, or ... or what. But I don't know I guess who all the countries that border the black sea, so I guess if I were to go off of this graph, I would say that it was false, or misleading. Umm."
54, 9, "Umm, that feels like something that could be real, I know that especially in that area there's not a lot of like, as much government regulation, especially with sustainable access, so if they were to say less than 85% had access to electricity, I would feel like that is a really large number, but I wouldn't necessarily be super surprised. I would say that that's true."
54, 10, "OK, so lowest proportion of the population. So the graph shows different countries, and then the length, and oh, it's of France's border regions. South Africa, and France's border regions. Uhh. The lowest proportion of the population... I guess, I guess uhh, I have no idea. Umm. It says the coast has the uhh, the most length. I'm not sure. I would say false. Actually, well, I guess if it's ... I don't know if it's comparing to these other countries, but... I would still say false. "
54, 11, "Umm, the longest coastal border. OK, I know Russia is extremely large, and looking at that map, not that I can see the top of it very clearly, but I mean that is a lot of coastal area. Looking at other countries that have coastal area, I feel like I thought somewhere that like, I feel like I've heard elsewhere that Russia didn't, but that was somewhere else. Like, especially with a lot of these other countries that aren't necessarily as large as Russia but that have long perimeters, but I guess looking at the map right now I can't see anything that would be larger... so I guess... I guess... I guess I would say yes, but I'm skeptical."
54, 12, "Uh, OK. So this shows Egypt's border regions, so OK, it shows the length of the coast, which is nearly 2500 km, and then, so the rest of these countries... so it looks like Sudan is around 1250, Libya around 10000, so that would be... I guess, yeah, this is about equal, just looking at this."
## Participant 30 = userID 55
55, 1, "There's a graph of Canada's population, well, at first, I thought Swaziland would be in Africa, that's cause I thought it was Swahili, so maybe it is in Africa, but I guess it's got a graph of Canada's population, so let's see... mostly middle age people, so... looks like, not really a normal distribution, but let's see, I guess it really has no correlation to the graph with the statement. I could believe that though, umm, but then again, it's hard to only border one country... well, I guess Canada. Wait, Canada, ... well, yeah, I guess it's not connected to Greenland. Well, yeah, yeah, OK, I'd say that's true."
55, 2, "Umm, OK, well, I thought of at first the Mercator projection, but that is really not reliable sometimes, for certain things, especially when you get to the extreme northern and southern parts of the map. I always thought that Russia was, well, Russia is pretty huge, but it's not as big as it is on the map. Well, it is a country. Of any country. I guess Australia, Australia would have to be the next one, or Antarctica, well I guess Antarctica is technically a continent, but I think I've also heard that It's also a country, we're going to throw that one out though. No, I think that's false, I think Australia has the largest one."
55, 3, "OK, same thing, Mercator projection. First thing that went through my mind was that like Africa is like, way, 14 times bigger than Greenland even though Greenland looks huge on the map. So Brazil is pretty close to the equator, so it's a pretty natural, er accurate size for it. The big ones would probably be Russia, china, India, the united states, and Australia, possibly, well Australia is pretty south on the Mercator projection. I feel like that's pretty specific. I'd say that's true though."
55, 4, "Uh, first thing I thought of was the 3 gorges dam in China, that is to me the most well known hydroelectric dam in the world. Just cause it's so huge. I don't, I think the hoover dam is hydroelectric. But I'm not sure that it is, actually, now that I think about it. I hope it would be, it's a pretty big dam to not be. Umm. South America, South America, is that pretty progressive in renewable energy? Umm, I wouldn't doubt that actually. Umm, 50% is a lot though. Then again, if it's small enough, you don't have to transmit the power that far. That's something we have to worry about more in the United States, I guess. But still, you'd still need a ton of rivers, well, there are a lot of rivers in South America, well, there's a lot of rivers everywhere. I don't know if that's... 50% is really high. I'd say they probably get a lot of energy from hydroelectric power, but I don't know if they get 50%. That's pretty high for a renewable, especially right now in today's society, cause it's not at that point yet. Like, being 2018."
55, 5, "OK, population of the United States. That looks shockingly similar to the population of Canada graph that I just saw, so I don't really know if I like that or not. Well, I guess it is a different range though. But it's still in ... 60, 60 million, 60 plus 30 plus 20, is 50, ... 110, plus 20 is ... well, double it, that's probably right. 30% from nuclear power plants. I do... in america it seems like we talk about Switzerland and the Netherlands, and like those northern European countries as more progressive, like Sweden, well, Switzerland kind of middle of Europe, more like Southern Europe, actually, but I still group it as one of those progressive countries. So I'd say... but nuclear power plants they really get a bad rap nowadays, not because they're inherently bad, but because we don't make em right, especially after Fukushima, at least that's what I think. But I live by a nuclear power plant, and that's how we get all our money in our town, so I guess I'm a little biased on that. but I feel like German leader Merkel said something about nuclear power plants and how she didn't like em. Maybe she didn't, maybe I'm thinking of something wrong. I'd say that's true. Yeah."
55, 6, "Between... Between the proportion of working age men and women, so that means that like the proportion of working age men is greater than the proportion of working age women I think. So Qatar, that's in the middle east, that's near Yemen and all those other countries, Pakistan, Afghanistan... I think we have a stereotype in America we have a stereotype that women aren't that powerful in those countries, even though in Saudi Arabia it's getting a lot better, umm, I haven't heard much about Qatar though, I think they were involved in the Iraq war, no, Kuwait, not Qatar. Uhh, Qatar. I have no idea. I'd say, I'd say that's true though. I'm probably basing that off of a stereotype. But, in general I feel like, well, yeah, I don't feel like stereotypes are inherently bad. Some are. I'd say that's probably true."
55, 7, "OK, and it shows a picture of mexico city. Umm, well, now I'm wondering if the other pictures in this thing were inaccurate. but that population of the United States thing was pretty accurate I think, based on the numbers. That's not the question though. OK. Egypt has approximately equal land and coastal borders. So that's in Northern Africa, kind of picturing it in my head, is that the Mediterranean sea maybe it is? Or the Gulf of Oman? No, the Mediterranean sea? Well, yeah, well of course. Not necessarily. Is that the Caspian sea? Well, I think it's probably equal, the northern and eastern parts of it are bordered by water I think.  "
55, 8, "OK, so maybe that was the black sea it borders. No, that reminds me... I feel like Greece borders the black sea, no, it definitely borders the Mediterranean sea. So this shows the salinity of Eurasian bodies of water, and it shows the black sea is lowest in grams per kilogram, I'm guessing that's grams of salt per kg of water. But that's really shocking, I always thought... I thought the black sea was the saltiest, cause you can float in it, but maybe not. But also the graphs haven't been necessarily right. Seven countries border the black sea. Seven countries is a lot. Seven... bordering anything seven times is a lot I feel like. But also, countries that border the water that's how they can have... like,  sharing that alone would be hard diplomatically I feel like. It's probably false. I feel like those European countries and part of Africa and part of Asia all... well, I don't know, I feel like they kind of hog it. If one country has it, I feel like they just gotta share it with everyone else. After they get they're thing on it. I feel like that's too many people on one body of water."
55, 9, "OK, well, we have a graph here, it talks about the age distribution of countries in Southern Africa. So that's just the southern part of the African continent, but South Africa is one of the countries, so if we're basing it off of the lowest proportion of the population under 15, that's the dark green part, so that would be Mauritius, Mauritius, just based off of the graph, cause that's the lowest proportion. Cause it starts at the base... Uhh, well, based on my previous experience with these pictures, I'd say that... well, the American population one was right, I think, well, the numbers added up. The Canada one was maybe kind of weird. The Mexico City one didn't really make sense actually. Well, you know, just based off of this graph I'm going to say false, because it's clearly not... Mauritius. Definitely has a lower proportion. "
55, 10, "OK, with a picture of the Roman Coliseum. Well, actually is that the roman coliseum? I feel like that is, well, actually, it looks like it's kind of small. That almost looks like, well, I don't know. The holes in the foreground look like someone made it out of clay. It looks pretty realistic. It's super small, also I feel like it had more than the upper two stories to it. Maybe I'm wrong. Belgium's population lives in urban areas. Umm, I'd say that's inherently false, just because, well, when I think of Northern Europe, I think Belgium is in Northern Europe, yeah, by Germany, yeah, they invaded Belgium didn't they, in WW2? Northern Europe, though, there are some big cities, but I also feel like when I picture northern Europe, there are lots of green pastures and lots of farms and ... I'm going to say false, 95% is a lot. That would be like if 95% of people in ... well I wonder if 95% of people in Illinois live in Chicago. No. There's no way."
55, 11, "Uh, I haven't even looked at the graph and I don't even know where Belize is, but I feel like... I don't know where Belize is, but I've heard about Belize in the news, but I've read about it. And, I can believe that actually. No, 85% is a lot though. Umm, I remember reading about like Iraq and how after we invaded Iraq they didn't have access to electricity, and we just kinda didn't really help them at all with that. I don't know what that has to do with this. Population of Belize... mostly middle aged or mostly young, so but that's in the thousands, 60 thousand, so small country. Umm, dang. I'm just going to go off the basis of 85% is a lot. Well, Belize could be a third-world country though. I mean, just cause we have access to electricity doesn't mean they couldn't... I'll say that's true. I'm going to infer that Belize is a 3rd world country. They don't have a lot of older population, so if you don't have a lot of older people that means you don't have really good healthcare, so we're going to say that's true."
55, 12, "I don't think that's Paraguay actually. I remember in Spanish class, we looked at south america a lot, and I feel like Paraguay is on the western coast of South Africa. But maybe it wasn't. Umm, now I'm thinking if the past question was actually Brazil though, so maybe it wasn't. I know Peru is on the western coast, though. I'm going to say... oh, I don't know... that's probably Paraguay. I'm going to say that's true. "

56, 1, "I think that is false, umm, because I k now that South Africa is fairly large and has a decently large population, and I'm sure that there are a lot of other African nations that are less populated, like I had a friend from a very small nation, so that's false."
56, 2, "I'm going to say that's true. I know that Europe does use nuclear power plants, I think France is one of the larger ones, I learned that in chemistry a couple of years ago. I'm going to say it's true."
56, 3, "Umm, I'll say that's true. I don't know much about this, but I know that in other nations that there is a large difference between the working age men and women, so I'll say it's true."
56, 4, "Umm, I'm going to say false. Belize is a neighbor of Mexico and the United States, right? So they should have some access to electricity. I don't know."
56, 5, "I'll say true. I think I don't know much about Belgium again, but I'm sure I know a lot of European countries are urbanized and densely populated, so I'll say true"
56, 6, "Umm, I'm going to say false. I know that some European countries get some of their electricity from hydroelectric generation, but I don't think that South America would, because they might be less developed than European nations."
56, 7, "Umm, I think that's true, I learned a song when I was in 6th grade about the countries, but I think I remember that it was landlocked. "
56, 8, "I'll say true. I know there are a lot of little countries around seas in, I think this is in like the Black Sea is around Europe, so I'll just go with true"
56, 9, "Umm, true. I don't know much about... I've never heard of that before, so I'm going to guess that it's true."
56, 10, "Umm, true. Brazil's pretty large, and it could definitely be up there in the top 5 largest countries, then, I'd assume."
56, 11, "I'm pretty sure that is true, I again haven't studied geography that much, but I know that it does have a very long border and it's in Europe and Asia"
56, 12, "Umm, I'll say false. Egypt I know is at the very top of Africa, so it is by water, but I'm not sure if it has countries that border both sides, but I'll assume that it does, so I'll say false."
## Participant 32 = userID 57
57, 1, "OK, I pronounced that wrong, it's Qatar. Actually pronounced, I say Qatar, but that's how I learned it. Between working age men and women. Well, I don't know if that's necessarily true. Because, my reasoning for that would be that Qatar is in the middle east and is bordered by Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, and those are typically ... umm, I don't know, I don't know. Cause I know Saudi Arabia just now a couple years ago allowed women to drive, so it could be... largest discrepancy. And Qatar definitely has a lot more western influences than a lot of the countries. Well, I don't know. I think this is false. It does border Saudi Arabia, and I think Saudi Arabia would have a larger discrepancy."
57, 2, "Coastal border... I don't know what that, that graph has absolutely nothing to do with the question. Coastal border, coastal border. That, that could be true. I think the only thing is a very large country, umm, all of the northern part of it is not touching land, I don't believe, umm. My only other concern would be like island nations like Australia, states not nations... umm. Coastal border. I can thing coast... I'm going to go this one as true, because it's a very large country and the northern part of it doesn't touch anything other than water."
57, 3, "That is Paraguay. That's definitely Paraguay, so that's true. Now I'm questioning... cause I know that's Paraguay... no, no that's true... there's no exceptions... that's true."
57, 4, "Umm, let me think. So, as a country gets more developed, their population tends to get older. South Africa is a pretty developed country in Africa, but is it the most developed? Nigeria's pretty developed, Egypt is as well, Kenya, I don't know, that's definitely not the only aspect to it. Lowest proportion. Well, the graph... oh, that has nothing to do with it. Working age population... it is darkest on that, but that's just cause this is South Africa and the countries I named are in North Africa. I'm going to go with false, cause there might be one... Yeah, I'm going to go with false."
57, 5, "OK, let me think. I know there's a lot of hydroelectric generation in the Amazon, but more than 50%? There are a lot of smaller countries up north in South America, ... Uhh. I actually didn't know about the population, that's interesting, but that has nothing to do with... hydro... umm, I think that's true. I don't know, a lot of these countries do have a lot of rain forest, so I don't know where they'd get it, they're not burning fossil fuels."
57, 6, "OK, Russia, Canada, United States. That's 3, so that doesn't help very much. Uhh, Kazakhstan... larger than Kazakhstan. Brazil is the largest in South America, but that doesn't help much, a lot of those countries are pretty small. Australia. What would be? China's pretty big. China... I think that's true, China is bigger and Brazil is 5th. I'm going to go with true on this one."
57, 7, "So the Black sea, which one is that? That's the... no, that's the dead sea. The black sea would be... It's weird to hear myself talking out these out loud. Russia, ... if that's the sea I'm thinking of... there's 3 of those countries there from the soviet union, Armenia, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan... but is that the Black sea? I've always wanted to know what the seas were, but never got around to learning that. Ukraine? That's 5. ... No. OK. I'm going to go with, I think I'm going to go with true on this one. Cause there's Russia, those 3 soviet states, Ukraine, Turkey... does Iran touch it or am I thinking of a different sea? I'm going to go with true on that one."
57, 8, "OK. Percent with electrical access... What? What is... OK, oh  wait, this is saying that 100% have access to electricity, right? Cause Nicaragua doesn't make it up to 100, which implies that they're making room for when it doesn't have electricity. OK. And Belize is relatively developed in comparison to other Central American countries. So I'm going to go with false on that one. Percent with electrical access. How can that be, that... No, if it were the percent of the population... that's false."
57, 9, "Well, that's, that picture is real cool, the United States. France is number 1 I believe, it's a lot bigger in Europe. France for sure gets more than 30. Switzerland is more... willing to develop different energy systems, I think, or different methods of gathering electricity, being that it's in Europe. But, OK. I think if there are 3, France is one, Germany would be another, could the Netherlands maybe? No, Netherlands uses wind. I'm going to go with true on this one, assuming that there are only 3, not less than that. Or I could be over thinking things."
57, 10, "Well it's not in southern Europe, so that's not going to help. 95% of Belgium's population lives in urban areas. OK, I think this is probably true, because Europe tends to be more  urban than the US and the US is 50/50. And Belgium is a smaller country, it's more... it's a northeast European country and those tend to live in more centralized cities. And densely... demographic, that has nothing to do with... over 95%. I think I'm going to go with ... I don't thing Belgium does a lot of farming, I'm going to go with true on this one. I can't name a lot of Belgian cities. I'm going to go with true on this one."
57, 11, "That's true. No, that's Lesotho, no, it borders multiple, Mozambique and South Africa. Lesotho is the one that's in South Africa, so Eswatini borders multiple. I think it's Mozambique. I remember when they changed the name to Eswatini, that was funny. Submit."
57, 12, "Oh, OK. That is Egypt. Let's think. I'm probably just going to approximate based on this picture. It's not the same length on the bottom and the top, but the top has more bumps, which does give more border. The same would go for the east and the west. But... yeah, I think this one... well, it looks like the right would be a lot more. I think this is true. Cause, the right side is definitely longer than the left side, but the bottom is longer than the top. Submit."
## Participant 33 = userID 58
58, 1, "Well, my first thought is that like Africa as a whole, they have a lot of diseases and things like with food that cause infants to die young, so I know they have a high infant mortality rate. And South Africa is not, I think it is one of the poorest nations in Africa. Lowest proportion of the population under 15 of all African nations. So I would probably say yes, because I know they're poorer so they may be more affected by the infancy mortality rates than the other African nations, so that's why I'm going to say true."
58, 2, "It has a picture of Melbourne, Australia. I'm not really sure why I'm seeing Australia when we're talking about Brazil. I know that Brazil is definitely big. I'm trying to think... the US has to be up there, it's one of the biggest in South America for sure. I'm trying to think of other countries that would be bigger than Brazil. Canada, ... maybe, I don't know, cause Canada doesn't have a ton of people? I don't know, is it supposed to be like land size or population size? Like US, Canada, Russia, Australia? No, that's a continent. I don't know. I am going to say false, I don't think so, although I'm not entirely sure."
58, 3, "So we have the imports right here, umm... what Transportation is one of the biggest ones, and Machinery. Discrepancy between... OK, so I don't know anything about Qatar, even where it's located. With machinery, that makes me think of factories, and factories make me think of like that there could be a discrepancy between the proportion of working age men and women, or transportation. Let's see. Those are the big ones. Miscellaneous, Metal. ... Working age men and women compared to neighboring countries. Yeah, I have no idea. I'm not quite sure where it's located, so... I feel like, OK, basically just basing this off of machinery and metals seem to be higher, they probably have a high working age population that work in factories, and ... umm, that could be a lot of like death for like women and children, although I am literally taking a shot in the dark I'm going to say true."
58, 4, "OK, umm, my first thought is is that even a place, cause I've never heard of either of these. Based on the picture, umm, I wonder geography, and I memorized a lot of these, and I don't recognize this from Africa although that would be my initial thought is possibly an African country, especially if it's like only bordering one country it's probably surrounded on 3 sides by water, is what this is saying, so it would be a bigger trade destination, and I feel like I would have heard of it if it was a trade destination, so I'm going to go with false. Cause, the only way I.... I think it might be a small country, kind of like Belgium. I have no idea. I'm going to go with false."
58, 5, "OK, so Switzerland is pretty like, they are like not in with like, they're more of like the neutral we're surrounded by mountains and we don't really care what's going on in the world. Not don't care, but don't want to be involved in world politics. Nuclear power plants in Europe... OK, this is going to be super helpful. So Switzerland, OK, Ireland has none, ... Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, so Germany... although, I don't know if they have 30% of their power from nuclear power plants. Like, I can definitely believe that, that's definitely believable. Especially since I know that they're a pretty advanced nation, I wouldn't put them at like France or Germany level, but I think that they are like pretty close. A third of their power from nuclear power plants. I know the US gets a chunk of power from nuclear plants too. I'm going to go with true."
58, 6, "OK, I've heard of this one at least. It has China's population, so this is not going to be helpful at all, cause population has nothing to do with geography, so I'm guessing... I'm just... I guess it's a guess in the dark. I would say that more than likely that's true, because I think that there's more ... it's landlocked, yeah that's true. "
58, 7, "OK, less than 85%. 85% is a lot. Like, I know that Belize probably has a lot less people that have access to electricity than the US or anything, any first world country that I can name. 85% is a lot. OK, electricity though. They probably have other stuff that they use. And if you don't have a power line going out somewhere, that could be a lot. Less than 85%, that would mean that 15% does have access. At most, 15%. That seems like a very, very small number. Especially in today's age. I think that like the US and other first world countries really help out people, so it could be, but I just have a hard time believing that 85% of the population has... less than 85. Oh OK, I'm reading this wrong. So less than 85% of the population of Belize has... oh OK. I definitely believe that. OK. At first I was thinking only 15% have access to electricity, that's small. OK, less than 85%. Yeah, 15% that doesn't have access to electricity is definitely believable."
58, 8, "Oh yeah, so this... there's at least 4 that border the Black sea. Seven countries... I think that that would be a thing. The Black sea is kinda by Egypt, along in that area. Seven, though, that's kind of a lot, to border it. And the Black sea isn't too big, cause it's a sea. I don't know if it's seven, I think it would be closer like 4 or 5. Don't you think? Yeah, I don't think it's 7. That's a little high for the black sea."
58, 9, "OK, I'm not quite sure what hydroelectronic generation is, but it could be water, like water electricity, generating it from either like dams, yeah, probably dams. 3 South American countries get more than 50% of their electricity. That could be like Brazil, Chile, ... umm, just has to be 3. More than 50%. 50% isn't a whole ton, especially like using water energy has been around long enough that this could be true, I'm going to go with true."
58, 10, "Oh, I definitely believe that. Russia's like huge, and coastal border... there, Let's see. I'm trying to think if there's anybody... I guess it is kinda like, a little landlocked, cause it runs into Europe. I'm trying to think if they have a country on top of them. I have no idea. I don't think they do though, and that would mean that they have a very big border. Coastal, that's the key word here. Cause it's big enough, and they do a lot of trading, so I'm going to go with true."
58, 11, "OK, Belgium. Belgium's pretty small. Umm, what would there... Urbanization in western Europe, so this could be kind of relevant. Oh, duh. Belgium's here. So rural, urban, percent of population, yeah, this is clearly over 95%... I think, 75%, so each of these, 25/2 is like 12 and a half, so like 77, 80, 7 1/2 right here, that's over 95%, so this is urban, so over 95% that's in urban areas, so yeah, that's true based on this."
58, 12, "Egypt, OK, so that's on the top of Africa. I don't think so, I think it has 3 around it, I'm trying to see if there's like a sea or anything that would be around that, but I don't think so. I think that there's more land borders for Egypt, so I'm going to say false."
## Participant 34 = userID 59
59, 1, "Let's see, percent electric generation, 3, more than 50%, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, Unless it's assuming that Paraguay isn't a South American country, then it's false because there are 4 countries that get more than 50%."
59, 2, "I know Brazil is pretty big, I'm not sure what it has to do with exports, ... China or India is in the top 1, I'm not sure, I guess I'd say true, just cause it seems, it seems plausible."
59, 3, "That's false, Russia is mostly landlocked."
59, 4, "That's there, OK, 85%, fuel generation... percent power... oh, OK. Hmm. I mean, I know it's down in Central America, but it seems possible that it wouldn't have access to electricity, but at the same time, it wouldn't, that's kind of making a racist assumption, just because it's in the general area of Mexico that it should be poverty stricken. Umm, at the same time, it seems OK. Yeah. "
59, 5, "I don't have anything to go off of on that one, so I'm just going to say it's false."
59, 6, "So, must be a Japan, Japanese city. Country. Working age men and women. I don't know, I'm going to say false."
59, 7, "So using the earlier question about Paraguay, if it's in South America, the majority of South American countries aren't landlocked, so I would say that has to be false."
59, 8, "Salinity of Eurasian bodies of water, that doesn't have anything to do with the border of the sea. Umm, the Black sea is in the middle of Europe. Seems kind of illogical that seven countries would be bordering something that can't be quite as big as I'm imagining, compared to the general sea that's between Africa and Europe. I know it's connected to that somehow, and if it is, I don't think it'd be big enough to tie to 7 countries. I'm going to say that's false."
59, 9, "The graph has nothing to do with that one either. I'm going to say true, because it has the sea going along the northern border, and the Nile river going along the eastern border, so as long as a river counts as a coast, then it would be."
59, 10, "Percent of Electricity from nuclear. Switzerland is... it's labeled. Well, it's false, the percent says it's 15-20."
59, 11, "Percent population that's 65 and up. Belgium. is near Germany, but Germany is... kind of like not even labeled, but... 95% in urban areas. I feel like there should be a connection there, the population of people that are 65 and up and living in urban areas. Umm, right, there's a movement, at least in America, recently moving from rural areas into urban areas. Now we're kind of seeing the reverse of that. Belgium is in Europe, so they don't have a lot of land resources to begin with, so it's probably just a lot of cities. I'm going to say it's true."
59, 12, "Assuming the picture that has anything to do with the question, that's a Canadian logo, that indicates that it might be in Canada. No, it can't be in Canada, you're asking about a separate country. So it doesn't relate to the question. I can't... I can't make a good guess on that one so I'm just going to say it's false."
## Participant 35 = userID 60
60, 1, "OK, so let's look at the demographics here. The red tells us that we have female, the blue tells us that we have male. I'm seeing the population graph on the Y and the age group for the x axis. So the Qatar graph is missing the 0-14 measurements on the bottom of the X axis, but I'm willing to take the leap to say that those are the same measurements, because there's the same number of spots between, there's the same number of spots for data, 5 each. And it looks like men significantly work more in the 25-54 age group, which makes sense because that's probably the age range in which most people are working. So I'm going to say that they have the largest discrepancy."
60, 2, "Umm, so Paraguay is in South America. I wish I knew more about South American geography. So it's a show of a waterfall, but that doesn't mean anything because that could be a river. I feel like Paraguay is... landlocked, it might be, I just don't have the. Sure."
60, 3, "Umm, so why would it be Switzerland? So one of those countries I suspect would be Japan... gets more than 30% of their power from nuclear power plants. I just don't get why it would be Switzerland, what makes Switzerland so different from other countries that could potentially use nuclear power plants. What else is there that Switzerland would get energy from? Wind, solar maybe? Umm, it's part of Europe, and I don't think there's any big water areas in Switzerland. I don't know, I'm going to say false, I think there are other countries that would have more nuclear power plants"
60, 4, "So Swaziland is in Africa, and I believe it's pretty small. Is it the one in South Africa? I think that's right. "
60, 5, "So I'm seeing a graph here that says Electrical access to Central America, and it says population with electricity, there's a bar that shows population with electricity, and there's a concentration thing with where there's if there's the most purple it will show 100%, and if it's white is 50%. Belize is the dark purple color, which is consistent with the 90-100% range, so I'm going to say that is false."
60, 6, "OK, umm. I know Brussels is the capital of Belgium. Is Belgium more of an urban area or more of a non-urban area, a rural area. This looks almost topographical, this map does, with mountains and stuff, so that's consistent, cause there's fewer cities it appears in that area, so it would make sense that there would be fewer people to live there. There's also some blue lines and some grey lines, the blue lines I'm going to guess are rivers, and the grey lines I don't know divvy it up into states or something like that. There's also some green things on the graph, totally a shot in the dark here, but I'm going to say the green are more of the rural areas and the white are more of the city areas, however land doesn't translate into number of people, but I haven't heard of Brussels being overly populous, but I'm going to guess urban because Europe. "
60, 7, "So the Black sea is... yeah, it's in that upper part of Africa. Largest 10 countries in Africa by total area, so that's really random. So Black sea's not by South Africa. Umm, seven seems high to me. Greece is by the Mediterranean, the north, the Baltic sea is by Norway, the dead sea is landlocked, I feel like the Black sea is that bottom area next to the Mediterranean, by Greece, Italy, that upper part of Africa. Seven seems reasonable, I guess. "
60, 8, "But you've given me a graph of Europe, so that's not useful. What do we know about South America? There's the Amazon, which is a very long river, so I can see how potentially somebody would be harvesting, water energy from that. Three South American countries get their electricity... what countries could those be? More than 50%, so what else would you be getting it from? Solar? Oil? I feel like it could be more, I'm going to say false. It's more than."
60, 9, "Religious affiliation in Egypt, so the percent of the population. What's... interesting. I'm going to say probably 15 and 85, that equals 100, 85 Muslim, 15 christian, but that doesn't have anything to do with what we're talking about. Approximately equal land and coastal borders, Egypt is in the upper part of Africa, half of it faces outward, half faces inward, but I'm think that the top part of Egypt is shorter than the bottom part, so I'm going to say false. "
60, 10, "So the largest country is Canada, followed by Russia. I could potentially see Brazil being the 5th largest country, but I'm trying to think of a country that could be larger than Brazil. Australia, probably. Sure, I'll go with it. True."
60, 11, "Maybe. Umm, the question is does Canada have more coastal border than Russia. Given all of the islands and stuff that they have, I could suspect that Canada has more than Russia."
60, 12, "OK, so I'm looking at the map of Southern Africa, southern Africa is the bottom country there, and they've given me another gradient where the percent of the population 25-54 is there, and the darkest green is 70%, the lowest white is 30%. South Africa is a lightish green, so the 40-50% range. That tells you 25-54, but that does not tell you age up vs. age down. So what percentage does the older population make up of, and what population does the older make up of? I mean, what else do I know about South Africa? I think it's fairly developed, so I don't think there would be any major diseases... water contamination things that could lead to younger mortality. I'm going to say false. "
## Participant 36 = userID 61
61, 1, "So I would say that would be false, because Switzerland is located close to a mountainous region, and I don't think they would really have a nuclear power plant close to that area."
61, 2, "Uh, I would say that would be true, because there isn't any other way of South American countries that I know from my basic knowledge that they would get their electricity from, so mostly the water..."
61, 3, "Umm, I would say that is true, because from what I know, ... the majority of Belize is located in a village area and like, there are like few cities that have access to some electricity. "
61, 4, "Oh, so I think that would be true, from what I have seen on an actual map. I visualize all of these countries, some way some form touching the black sea."
61, 5, "Uh, for this one I would, it's kind of hard to make a decision, equal land and coastal borders. I would probably say true, just because it's location close to water, and at the same time, it's also located to some other countries as well."
61, 6, "Uh, I would say that's true, because... So Belgium is close to Germany and France, and from what I know those are also heavily populated areas in terms of urbanization, so it would be safe to assume that Belgium would also be true."
61, 7, "Umm, so this one I don't... I couldn't give a great guess, but from what I know from my previous knowledge, I'd have to say false, because South Africa from what I learned has a lot more people than ... than from other African nations."
61, 8, "I'm going to have to go with true, because this one I have actually read from a website in terms of top countries that are huge."
61, 9, "This one, I'd probably say false because I'm pretty sure this is located in Europe, and there are several countries that are located in Central Europe, and that's where I believe Swaziland is located. "
61, 10, "I would have to say... true, just because of the location of Paraguay in South America and what exactly is bordering the area. "
61, 11, "And, I'm... I'm going to have to say true, just because from what I ... from what I ... my knowledge of the Middle East and what I've seen for trips and for like school studies is, umm, it's like, so for their culture, it's like a large difference between the working age men and women compared to all of the countries like Asia and around the world."
61, 12, "So this one I'm going to have to say is true, just because it's the largest country and also it has ... stretches all the way from Western Europe to close to Alaska, and it just has a huge border, longer coastline."
## Participant 37 = userID 62
62, 1, "I know that that is not true, Swaziland borders both Mozambique and South Africa. Umm, I would also believe that border distribution. Yeah, that is not a true statement. Also, based on the graph, it says that Mozambique borders Swaziland as well as South Africa."
62, 2, "Percent of population 25-54. It's definitely the darkest green. The question is asking about the difference between working age men and women. But this shows the population percentage, based on the age, as opposed to based on the gender, so I don't think there's any way of knowing based on this graph. I would assume that's true, though, because I know that Qatar has a funky looking age to gender gap. I say that's true."
62, 3, "This is a graph of India's ethnic makeup, between Dravidian, Indo-Aryan, and Mongoloid, or other, as a percentage of the population. This graph has nothing to do with the statement. I do know that Canada has a longer coastal border than Russia, so this statement is false but not because of the graph"
62, 4, "I know that Belgium has two cities of over a million population, both Brussels and Antwerp, and I also know that it's pretty small geographically. I can't imagine that there would be that much land that is divided between... that could be used for farming, then again, 95% is pretty overwhelming, and though I would assume it is above 80, I think 95 is a bit of a stretch, so I'm going to say that statement is false."
62, 5, "This is population of Belize with an age and population in thousands and gender. Belize is a pretty small country in Latin america, I can't imagine that 85 would be a tipping point one way or another. I would assume that because it's in Latin america, that would be believable, that less than 85% have access to electricity. I'm going to say that's true. Yeah, that's true."
62, 6, "Is this going by population or land? Well, that's a picture of a kangaroo, which is native to Australia. The largest countries are, in order, Russia, Canada, United States, China, Brazil. I know that to be true, but I have no basis for that because of the picture."
62, 7, "I know that Africa has experienced a population boom in the past 100 years or so. I know that countries like Nigeria, the average birth rate is like 7.8, which is very high, and historically countries get less... as countries industrialize more and modernize more, their birthrate slows, because infant mortality typically goes down as well, and just child mortality in general. So knowing that South Africa is among the most industrialized of the African countries, I would say that's true, and knowing that there are over 50 countries in Africa, and I wouldn't be willing to bet that Egypt or Morocco or one of the island nations like the Seychelles has a higher population, just because if it was purely random, it would have such a small chance."
62, 8, "Umm, this is a graph of Paraguay's population in millions based on age and gender. Again, this has nothing to do with Paraguay's landlockedness. I know that Paraguay is landlocked, but not because of this graph whatsoever."
62, 9, "This is a map of Africa. None of the neighboring bodies of water are mapped, or at least they're not named. I don't think seven countries border the black sea. It would be Ukraine, Georgia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, that's six, I don't think I'm missing any, Armenia? No, Armenia doesn't border... Russia, though, Russia does. That's seven. So that's true, but I have no reason to believe that based on the map."
62, 10, "Oh, this one is easier to read. Percent of hydro power, 0-25, 25... I'm looking for anything above that tealy color, which would be Paraguay, Ecuador, Colombia all have that, pretty sure Brazil too, yeah, Brazil. Which is four, meaning that is true, wait, false, because 4 countries get more than 50% of their electricity from hydroelectric generation."
62, 11, "This is a distribution graph of Switzerland's age... oh, of the United States' population. I'm fairly sure Switzerland is, but that doesn't relate to the graph at all. True."
62, 12, "I know Egypt has their northern border against the Mediterranean sea and their eastern border against the red sea, and then I would assume the red sea border is similar length to their border with Sudan, although that's a disputed border, but it's a pretty similar length. And then the Mediterranean border is pretty similar to their border with Libya, and the water around the Sinai peninsula I assume would be pretty similar to Egypt, so I would say that's true, it would be about the same."
